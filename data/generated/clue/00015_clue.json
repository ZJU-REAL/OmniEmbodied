We're doing our first ever TV special in a few weeks. It's WAIT WAIT...DON'T TELL ME!'s year in review for 2011.\n\nIt's an hour long television special on BBC America, on Friday, December 23rd, and it will also be heard on your favorite public radio station that weekend. I know it will be a tough choice between Carl and Frost the Snowman, but Carl does not need no magic hat to talk.\n\n\nSAGAL: That's WAIT WAIT...DON'T TELL ME!'s year in review TV special on BBC America December 23rd. Right now, panel, time for you to answer some questions about this week's news. Kyrie?\n\n\nSAGAL: The mafia, organized crime, as we know, always been deeply involved in, like, garbage, waste management. Now they're changing with the times. In New Jersey at least, they're getting deeply involved with what?\n\nO'CONNOR: Oh my goodness. I didn't know they changed their...\n\nSAGAL: Well, it's kind of they're progressive. They're progressing from simple garbage to?\n\nO'CONNOR: Recycling.\n\nSAGAL: Recycling, yes.\n\n\n\n\nSAGAL: Turns out that the recycling industry in New Jersey is a huge source of profit for organized crime families there. A new report from the state lays it all out. That's right, New Jersey itself is publicizing the fact that the state is deeply corrupt with murderous mob families because they'd rather be known for that than for \"Jersey Shore.\"\n\n\nSAGAL: The investigation was a decade in the making. Some residents were suspicious early on when recycling facilities asked them to separate glass, paper and dead body into separate containers.\n\n\nPETER GROSZ: It's really like it'd be a shame if that can didn't go in the green container there.\n\nSAGAL: Yeah.\n\n\nSAGAL: Isn't it odd to think of the mafia becoming environmentally aware? It's like, hey, I'll make him an offer he can't reuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait Wait...Don't Tell Me!\nSupport comes from:\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *A Mob-Linked Recycling Facility with Eco-Criminal Undertones*  \n\nInspired by the absurd yet darkly comedic image of the mafia pivoting from traditional waste management to \"eco-friendly\" recycling rackets, this scene is a **repurposed industrial warehouse** functioning as a **front for organized crime**. On the surface, it’s a bustling recycling plant—conveyor belts, sorting bins, and safety posters—but hidden compartments, illicit materials, and coded communications reveal its true nature.  \n\nThe scene is *inherently collaborative*: workers must coordinate to sort recyclables (legitimate and illegal), operate heavy machinery, and conceal contraband. The environment is dense with **dual-purpose objects** (e.g., a compactor that crushes cans *and* evidence) and **layered deception** (e.g., \"glass recycling\" bins hiding smuggled goods).  \n\n---  \n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Sorting Floor**  \n   - A cavernous space with rusted steel beams, flickering fluorescents, and the hum of machinery. Dominated by a **conveyor belt system** feeding into sorting stations.  \n   - *Key Feature:* A **giant electromagnet crane** (used for scrap metal; also to \"accidentally\" drop loads on unwanted visitors).  \n\n2. **Quality Control Office (The \"Legitimate\" Front)**  \n   - A glass-walled room overlooking the floor, filled with clipboards and fake compliance certificates.  \n   - *Key Feature:* A **false-bottomed desk** hiding ledgers of illicit transactions.  \n\n3. **Backroom \"Special Materials\" Storage**  \n   - A locked, soundproofed area marked \"Hazardous Waste Only.\" Inside: **shredded documents, unmarked barrels**, and a **disassembled car chassis** (stripped for parts/VIN removal).  \n   - *Key Feature:* A **floor hatch** leading to a subterranean tunnel network.  \n\n4. **Break Room (With Secrets)**  \n   - A dingy space with a broken coffee machine, a bulletin board with **coded shift schedules**, and a **vending machine** that doesn’t take money (used to pass small parcels).  \n\n---  \n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Sorting Floor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Conveyor Belt**: 12m long, 1.5m wide, with a **stuck \"emergency stop\" button** (requires two people to reset).  \n- **Electromagnet Crane**: 3-ton capacity, controlled via a **rusted joystick panel** (sparks intermittently).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Glass Recycling\" Bin**: Actually a **double-walled container**; outer layer holds bottles, inner compartment stores **unregistered handguns** wrapped in cloth.  \n- **Baler Machine**: Compacts cardboard; jammed with a **bloodstained leather jacket** (partially visible).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Pallet Jack**: Hydraulic, max load 500kg—useful but **missing its handle** (improvised crowbar nearby).  \n- **Safety Station**: **Empty fire extinguisher mount**, a **cut phone line**, and a **leaking chemical drum** labeled \"non-toxic\" (smells like ammonia).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Union Poster**: Peeling off the wall, revealing graffiti: *\"Tony pays 20%”*.  \n- **Dirty Lunchboxes**: Stacked near the belt, one slightly ajar—**a listening device** hidden inside.  \n\n---  \n#### **2. Quality Control Office**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Steel Desk with False Bottom**: Top holds recycling logs; hidden compartment contains a **ledger** (columns for \"Scrap Tonnage\" and \"Cement Shoes\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Computer Monitor**: Displaying CCTV feeds—**one camera is looped** (shows empty hallway).  \n- **Wall Safe**: Behind a **framed \"Employee of the Month\" photo**, combo lock (hint: date of the facility’s \"grand opening\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label Maker**: Out of tape, but a **half-printed label** reads \"*FRAGILE—HUMAN R*\".  \n- **Paper Shredder**: Jammed with a **credit card fragment** (name: \"V. Corleone\").  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- **Coffee Cup Rings**: Stained into a blueprint; under UV light (blacklight in the break room), reveals **warehouse tunnel routes**.  \n\n---  \n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Electromagnet Crane**: Requires two agents—one to operate the joystick (sticky controls), another to guide the load (unstable swinging).  \n- **Contraband Barrel** (in Backroom): 200kg, **sealed with a corroded latch**—needs one agent to hold it steady while another pries it open.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning**:  \n  - Among five **\"Hazardous Waste\" barrels**, only one has:  \n    - **Faded green stripes** (others are red/yellow).  \n    - **A serial number scratched off** (visible under angled light).  \n    - **Wet residue** near the cap (smells like acetone, not waste).  \n  - Distractor: Nearby **green mop bucket** (similar color).  \n\n- **Compound Tool Use**:  \n  - **Problem**: Wall safe requires a combo.  \n  - **Solution**: **Combo hint** is in the break room (UV light reveals date on a coffee-stained calendar).  \n  - **Tool**: **Blacklight** is inside the broken vending machine (requires shaking to dislodge).  \n\n---  \n### **Atmosphere & Sensory Details**  \n- **Sound**: Distant **dripping water**, occasional **metal creaks** (is it the building, or someone in the tunnels?).  \n- **Smell**: **Ozone from faulty wiring** masking **sweet decay** (backroom).  \n- **Light**: **Flickering fluorescents** cast shadows that make conveyor belts look like they’re moving when idle.  \n\nThis scene is a **pressure cooker of collaboration**—agents must navigate literal and metaphorical filters, where every object could be a clue, a weapon, or a liability. The mafia’s \"eco-friendly\" veneer is thin, and the environment rewards teams who **look deeper than the surface**."
