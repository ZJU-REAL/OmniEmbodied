Switched from PC and never regretted. They work well, looks good and have high quality components. They are more expensive but, in my experience last longer.\n\nHowever, if money is tight, get a refurbed desktop from a reputable supplier on eBay. I've bought nearly 20 PCs for bargain prices and they all work very well (but for my dislike of Windows).\n\nRyvitaHayworth Fri 27-Sep-13 18:30:13\n\nThanks a lot Snorbs, much appreciated.\n\nSnorbs Wed 18-Sep-13 18:43:37\n\nDell do non-touch versions of their business all-in-one PCs. Have a look here. Prices start from £600 or so.\n\nI'm not convinced on the value of touch on such devices. I remember spending huge amounts of money back in the early 90s on touch-based desktop PC displays for a work project and they get uncomfortable to use very quickly as your arm gets tired. Touch works brilliantly on handheld devices but not so well on desk-bound ones.\n\nI'm mainly a PC user but I do have a Macbook Air as well. I find swapping from Windows to OSX irritating because they look similar enough for me to assume they work the same but they don't. It's the little things that end up annoying me the most, like the Mac's keyboard layout being different, and me having to remember which coloured blob on the top of the window does what.\n\nOffice on Mac does work very much like Office on PC and they are very compatible but it's all the other stuff that's the issue. To take an example that annoyed me recently, sharing printers. It's very easy to share printers between PCs. It's very easy to share printers between Macs. Sharing a printer among Macs and PCs can be a lot harder.\n\nIf your husband's work is a PC-based operation then introducing a Mac without a good reason - eg, he needs a particular Mac application for which there simply isn't a good equivalent on PC - could well end up just being a pain.\n\nRyvitaHayworth Wed 18-Sep-13 16:48:52\n\nThe HP ones similar to the iMac seem to be touch screens. A bit over the top?\n\nIs there any reason to choose a PC over a Mac these days? Isn't everything compatible with everything else now? Except Access, which won't be an issue.\n\nRyvitaHayworth Wed 18-Sep-13 13:52:35\n\nI would think up to about 1,000.\n\nSnorbs Wed 18-Sep-13 12:34:04\n\nWhat's your budget?\n\nRyvitaHayworth Tue 17-Sep-13 17:43:17\n\nNew PC time. I am a bit out of touch with the PC market, being an Apple user, but my husband has asked me to look up a new PC for him for work. So obviously rather than actually spend time comparing specs from various suppliers I came straight to MN...\n\nCan anyone recommend a good PC for office use - so really just MS Office, an email package and a browser - no singing or dancing required. Would like it to be as wireless as possible, and an all-in-one like the iMac. Lovely screen would be nice. In fact, a PC version of the iMac would probably suit perfectly.\n\nThank you! I will be sure not to mention you at all when his gratitude for my hours of research knows no bounds wink.\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nJoin the discussion\n\n\nRegister now\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Tech Support & Refurbishment Workshop\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling **computer refurbishment and repair workshop**, where a team of technicians collaborates to diagnose, repair, and upgrade a mix of old and new desktop machines. The space is a hybrid between an electronics repair lab and a logistics hub, where multiple workstations handle different stages of the refurbishment process.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Large Object Handling:** Some machines (e.g., bulky servers, all-in-one PCs) require multiple people to lift safely.  \n- **Specialized Roles:** Different agents may focus on diagnostics, hardware repair, software installation, or inventory management.  \n- **Shared Resources:** Tools and parts are spread across workstations, requiring coordination to avoid bottlenecks.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe workshop is divided into **four interconnected zones**:  \n\n1. **Incoming Inspection & Intake Area** – Where new and returned machines are logged, assessed, and tagged.  \n2. **Diagnostic & Repair Bay** – Workstations with specialized tools for hardware and software troubleshooting.  \n3. **Refurbishment & Assembly Station** – Cleaner, more organized space for reassembling machines after repairs.  \n4. **Storage & Parts Inventory** – Shelving units and labeled bins holding spare components, cables, and peripherals.  \n\nThe workshop has a **lived-in, slightly chaotic** feel—tools left mid-use, half-drank coffee mugs, and a faint hum of cooling fans in the background.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Zone 1: Incoming Inspection & Intake Area**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty metal workbench** (200cm long, reinforced steel legs, scuffed surface from years of use).  \n- **Rolling inventory cart** (with a clipboard holding intake forms, a barcode scanner dangling off the side, and a stack of anti-static bags).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Problematic\" iMac (2013 model)** – Cracked screen, missing power cord, scuff marks on the aluminum casing. Shipping label reads: \"RETURN – OS corruption suspected.\"  \n- **Dell all-in-one PC (OptiPlex 7480)** – Sticky note on screen: \"Printer sharing issue. Won’t detect network.\"  \n- **Weighing scale (digital, max 30kg)** – Used to log machine weights for shipping estimates.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label printer** – Out of paper, \"TAPE LOW\" warning LED blinking.  \n- **Toolbox (open)** – Contains screwdrivers, pliers, and a spudger. One Phillips-head screwdriver is missing.  \n- **USB hub (7-port, powered)** – Three cables plugged in, but only one is active (flashing data transfer light).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded \"ESD Safe Zone\" poster** (peeling at the corners).  \n- **Stack of old PC World magazines** (2010-2015 issues, collecting dust).  \n- **Coffee stain rings** on the workbench.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Zone 2: Diagnostic & Repair Bay**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Adjustable-height workbench** (with integrated power strips, one outlet loose).  \n- **Overhead magnifying lamp** (LED, adjustable arm, slight flicker).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **MacBook Air (2015, open on repair stand)** – Logic board exposed, thermal paste drying. Note: \"Boot loop after liquid spill.\"  \n- **HP Touchscreen AIO (broken hinge)** – Screen partially detached, requires two people to stabilize during repair.  \n- **Multimeter** – Set to continuity mode, leads tangled.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Anti-static wrist strap** – Dangling off the bench, not connected to ground.  \n- **Soldering station** – Iron resting in holder, sponge dry.  \n- **External HDD (WD 2TB)** – Label: \"OS Recovery Images.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"No Food or Drink\" sign** (ignored—half-empty energy drink can nearby).  \n- **Dusty old CRT monitor** (used as a makeshift stand for tools).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Zone 3: Refurbishment & Assembly Station**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Clean work mat (anti-static, blue)** – Slightly frayed at the edges.  \n- **Rolling tool cabinet (12 drawers)** – Labels: \"Screws,\" \"Cables,\" \"Adhesives.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Freshly wiped Lenovo ThinkPad** – Awaiting RAM upgrade (two 8GB sticks in a labeled bag nearby).  \n- **USB-C docking station** – Missing one port cover.  \n- **Sealed box of thermal paste** – Expiry date: next month.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Air duster can** – Half-full, lying on its side.  \n- **RGB mechanical keyboard (for testing)** – Keycap puller resting on top.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Employee of the Month\" certificate** (from 2018, crookedly hung).  \n- **Sticky note on wall**: \"Remember: Check BIOS settings before sealing!\"  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The HP AIO PC (Zone 2)** – Requires two people to safely lift (weight: 15kg, awkward grip points due to detached hinge).  \n- **Server rack chassis (Zone 4)** – 150kg, needs a dolly and coordination to maneuver around tight corners.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five identical-looking **Dell OptiPlex desktops**, only one has a **red asset tag** and a **scratched S/N label**, making it the correct unit for a warranty claim.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The iMac in Zone 1 won’t boot (OS corruption).  \n  - **Solution:** The **external HDD in Zone 2** contains recovery images, but it needs to be **plugged into the USB hub in Zone 1** (which is missing a cable).  \n  - **Distractor:** The **label printer in Zone 1** is out of paper, which might be mistakenly prioritized first.  \n\n#### **Atmosphere & Realism Boosters:**  \n- **Ambient sounds:** Distant chatter from a radio, occasional beeps from diagnostic tools.  \n- **Visual clutter:** A \"Wi-Fi password\" sticky note hidden under a keyboard.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes:**  \nThis **densely packed, multi-functional workshop** is primed for **collaborative problem-solving**, requiring agents to:  \n✔ **Communicate** to share tools and parts across stations.  \n✔ **Coordinate** on heavy or unwieldy objects.  \n✔ **Reason** about tool dependencies (e.g., needing a specific screwdriver from another zone).  \n✔ **Filter distractions** (background clutter, incomplete tasks) to focus on critical objectives.  \n\nThe scene naturally supports **diagnostics, repairs, upgrades, and inventory management**—all while feeling **lived-in and authentic**."
