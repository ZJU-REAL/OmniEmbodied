This has previously led to talk of a goldrush in 60GHz spectrum.\n\n“Certainly, the higher up the spectrum you go, the larger the amount of data you can carry,” said a spokesman for Ofcom in the UK. “But the problem is that the range is very limited.”\n\nHe pointed out the similarities of the high frequency technology to UWB (ultra-wideband) technology, which is finally reaching the market after years of wrangling between different engineering bodies and companies.\n\nIn the UK, UWB operates between the 3.1GHz and 10.6GHz band. From August 13, Ofcom removed the requirement for a licence to operate UWB equipment. In the US and Japan, UWB equipment is already exempt from the need to hold a licence.\n\nUnlike higher frequencies, UWB currently has a maximum speed of about 480Mbit/s, which while sounding impressive, may not be enough for all applications.\n\nPreviously, specialised radios have been needed in order to send and receive high-frequency signals. The GEDC has been seeking to covert these specialised radios into small chips and reduce the cost of the equipment.\n\nLaskar has set his sights on a $5 chip, and so far his researchers have apparently hammered together a few prototypes to show off the technology.\n\nLaskar and his colleagues also believe that as the range of these very high frequencies will likely be less than 33 feet, interference is less likely and transmissions could be more secure.\n\nA couple of years ago Ofcom admitted that because of the demand for spectrum in the highly congested lower frequency spectrum bands, there was now a need to consider the higher frequencies for communications systems.\n\nThe UK telecoms and broadcasting regulator is considering more licence-exempt spectrum, but has said that high frequency systems suffer much greater propagation losses, which make them unsuitable for long range applications. However, its research showed that the higher frequency bands could be useful for a range of applications, including:\n\n- Broadband fixed wireless access with very high capacities. This could allow applications such as HDTV to the home to be deployed on demand.\n\n- Fixed line of sight point-to-point links, where link lengths of up to 5km are possible with 99.99 percent availability, supporting short range backhaul.\n\n- High speed (1Gbit/s) short range wireless LANs, operating over a range of a few hundred metres. This could be used to provide a wireless access system for large buildings such as exhibition halls.\n\n- Short range repeaters (500m to 1km) with very high data rates of up to 5GHz for applications such as network backhaul. Such systems could be applied to a lamp post-mounted system for the provision of high bandwidth backhaul to a city-wide Wi-Fi network.\n\nOfcom said that it will publish its policy on the use of the 60GHz (and above) band later this year.\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\nHands-on with Sony's latest smartglasses\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\n",

Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *High-Frequency Wireless Research Lab*  \n**Core Concept:** A cutting-edge electronics laboratory where researchers are prototyping next-gen 60GHz wireless transceivers. The lab is a hive of collaborative activity, with engineers, technicians, and AI assistants working together to assemble, test, and troubleshoot high-frequency communication chips. The environment is dense with delicate equipment, precise measurement tools, and experimental setups—many requiring coordinated effort due to size, fragility, or procedural complexity.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Precision assembly** of millimeter-wave antenna arrays requires simultaneous calibration and soldering.  \n- **Heavy testing rigs** demand multiple agents to maneuver safely.  \n- **Real-time data monitoring** across distributed sensor arrays necessitates parallel observation.  \n- **Interference mitigation** requires synchronized adjustments between distant workstations.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe lab is divided into four interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Prototyping Bay** – A cluttered workspace with 3D printers, soldering stations, and microscopes. The air smells of flux and ozone.  \n2. **Testing Chamber** – A shielded room with anechoic foam walls, housing a robotic arm manipulating a 60GHz transmitter prototype.  \n3. **Data Hub** – A server rack-filled alcove with flickering monitors displaying signal integrity metrics.  \n4. **Storage & Logistics** – Overloaded shelves and lockers containing labeled components, spare parts, and calibration tools.  \n\n---\n\n### **3.
