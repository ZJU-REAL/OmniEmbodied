He satirized both Howards in The Sullen Lovers (1668), an adaptation of Molière’s Les Fâcheux.\n\nShadwell wrote 18 plays, including a pastoral, The Royal Shepherdess (1669), an opera, The TempestEnchanted Island (1674; adapted from Shakespeare’s The Tempest), a tragedy, Psyche (1674–75), and a blank verse tragedy, The Libertine (1675). He translated Juvenal’s The Tenth Satyr (1687) and composed bitter attacks upon John Dryden. He also instituted the New Year and birthday odes when he became poet laureate.\n\nShadwell’s friendship with Dryden ended with the political crisis of 1678–79, when Shadwell espoused the Whig cause, producing The Lancashire Witches, which caused offense with its antipapist propaganda and attacks upon the Anglican clergy. Their feud produced three satires by each in the course of 1682, of which the best known are Dryden’s Absalom and Achitophel and his mock-heroic verse satire, MacFlecknoe. The issue was partly political, partly a difference of opinion over dramatic technique, particularly Dryden’s scorn for Ben Jonson’s wit and Shadwell’s uncritical reverence for him.\n\nWhen Dryden was removed from the laureateship and the position of historiographer royal during the Glorious Revolution (1688–89), Shadwell succeeded him. Shadwell continued in Jonson’s style of the comedy of “humours” in many of his plays. They form a link between Jonson’s art and the realistic fiction of the age of Fielding. The Humourists (1670) was a failure because he satirized the vices and follies of an age that did not care for generalized satire. His next play, The Miser (1671–72), was a rhymed adaptation of Molière that showed his gradual shift toward the wit of the comedy of manners. Epsom-Wells (1672) became his greatest success, being played for nearly half a century. The Virtuoso (1676) was an inventive satire of the Royal Society. In The Squire of Alsatia (1688) he presented middle-class people and villains, rascals and thieves. Bury-Fair (1689) showed the influence of the popular farce that was to put his fame in eclipse in his later years. His last play, The Scowrers (1690), was a precursor of sentimental comedy.\n",
