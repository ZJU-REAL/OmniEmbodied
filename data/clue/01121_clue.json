I have added the following to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !www.example.com [NC]\nRewriteRule \\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif) - [F,NC,L]\n\nThis is the most basic example I have tried (this one is straight from the Apache site http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/rewrite/access.html)\n\nI have also tried adding a caret in front of the URL, adding slashes before the URL dots to escape them, making the www portion optional, adding https? in front of the URL, and not using the blank referrer line. All without success.\n\nShould I be placing the rules elsewhere (such as a VirtualHosts file)?\n\nshare|improve this question\nThese lines should go inside the VirtualHosts context. –  sysadmin1138 Sep 30 '13 at 23:50\nSo it is not possible to add this directive to all domains through httpd.conf then? –  foochow Sep 30 '13 at 23:57\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 0 down vote accepted\n\nVirtualhosts do not automatically inherit rewriterules that are defined in the main server context. If you want to inherit the rules you need to add this to each virtualhost context that you want to use the rules defined in the server context:\n\nRewriteOptions Inherit\nshare|improve this answer\nMakes sense, thanks for the information. Good to know it is possible at a global scope. –  foochow Oct 7 '13 at 20:58\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Server Room Heist\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-security server room in a tech corporation, where a critical data transfer is about to take place. The environment is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Heavy, complex equipment** requiring coordinated handling.  \n- **Security protocols** necessitating role-based access (e.g., one agent has a keycard, another knows the firewall bypass).  \n- **Time-sensitive failures** (e.g., overheating servers, failing backup generators).  \n- **Hidden sabotage clues** (e.g., tampered cables, misplaced admin logs).  \n\nThe scene is tense—dim emergency lighting, the hum of servers, occasional flickering monitors—forcing agents to rely on precise coordination under pressure.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe server room is split into three zones:  \n\n1. **Main Server Hall** – A maze of towering server racks, blinking indicator lights, and tangled cabling. Overhead, a broken AC unit drips condensation onto a warning sign.  \n2. **Security & Monitoring Hub** – A glass-walled control room with a bank of monitors, access terminals, and a locked firewall override panel.  \n3. **Maintenance & Supply Closet** – Crowded with spare parts, toolkits, and a wheezing backup generator. A fuse box sparks intermittently.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Server Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Server Rack Alpha (2.5m tall, 800kg, bolted to floor)** – Primary data storage.  \n- **HVAC Unit (partially dislodged, dripping water)** – Malfunctioning, pooling water near electrical wiring.  \n- **Emergency Power Switch (behind a plexiglass cover, requires key)** – Critical for shutdown.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Admin Keycard (left on top of Server Rack Gamma)** – Grants firewall override access.  \n- **Tampered Ethernet Cable (blue, labeled \"Backup Link\")** – Disconnected, causing network lag.  \n- **Overheating Server (LEDs flashing red, internal fan jammed)** – Requires immediate cooling or shutdown.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Rolling Tool Cart (wobbly left wheel, holds a thermal gun and spare cables)**  \n- **Fire Extinguisher (wall-mounted, last inspection date expired)**  \n- **Network Diagnostic Terminal (screen frozen on \"Connection Error\")**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee stain on a discarded \"Server Maintenance Log\" (illegible)**  \n- **Dusty \"Employee of the Month\" photo (2018, cracked frame)**  \n- **Graffiti sticker on a rack (\"#NoFirewalls\")**  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Security & Monitoring Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Firewall Override Terminal (biometric scanner, offline)** – Requires manual keycard override.  \n- **Surveillance Monitor Wall (one screen flickering with static)**  \n- **Locked Gunmetal Cabinet (contains backup drives, needs two keys)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Biometric Scanner (error: \"Failed to Authenticate\")**  \n- **Security Key (hidden in a hollowed-out manual titled \"OS Troubleshooting\")**  \n- **Overwritten Access Logs (last entry: \"User 4472 – Unauthorized Command\")**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Swivel Chair (one wheel missing, squeaks loudly)**  \n- **Printer (out of paper, error light blinking)**  \n- **Radio (playing static, volume stuck on max)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Fake Plant (covered in dust, one leaf missing)**  \n- **\"NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS\" poster (partially torn)**  \n- **Half-eaten donut on a napkin (stale)**  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Maintenance & Supply Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Backup Generator (rattling, fuel gauge at 10%)**  \n- **Tool Wall (missing the 10mm wrench, labeled slot empty)**  \n- **Fuse Box (sparks when touched, labeled \"Caution: High Voltage\")**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Coolant Canister (needs to be carried to overheating server, 25kg, two-hand grip required)**  \n- **Missing 10mm Wrench (found under a pile of tangled wires)**  \n- **Spare Keycard (hidden inside a hollowed-out battery compartment)**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Broken Vacuum (cord frayed, plugged in but non-functional)**  \n- **Leaky Pipe (dripping into a rusty bucket)**  \n- **Stack of Obsolete Hard Drives (labeled \"FOR DESTRUCTION\")**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Safety First!\" poster (defaced with doodles)**  \n- **Coffee Maker (carafe cracked, stale grounds inside)**  \n- **Mystery Key (on a hook, unlabeled, fits nothing obvious)**  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Coolant Canister (25kg, requires two agents to carry safely)** – One must stabilize while the other navigates around obstacles.  \n- **Server Rack Panel (150kg, needs lifting while another agent accesses wiring behind it)** – Impossible solo.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - **Five keycards on a desk** – Only one has a **blue stripe, chip scratch, and \"ADMIN\" imprint**. The rest are decoys.  \n  - **Three coolant canisters** – One is **unlabeled, half-full, with a corroded valve**—using the wrong one could damage the server.  \n\n- **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** Overheating server.  \n  - **Solution:** **Find coolant (Maintenance Closet) → Locate thermal gun (Tool Cart) → Disable faulty fan (requires wrench from hidden spot).**  \n  - **Distractor:** A **non-functional fire extinguisher** nearby might mislead agents.  \n\n#### **Environmental Challenges:**  \n- **Time Pressure:** Backup generator fuel depletes in 10 minutes.  \n- **Security:** Unauthorized access triggers alarms if agents don’t disable the firewall first.  \n- **Sabotage:** Tampered cables must be identified among identical ones.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** This scene is **dense with intentional problems**—some solvable, some red herrings—forcing agents to **communicate, verify, and collaborate under pressure.** Every object has a purpose, whether as a tool, obstacle, or atmospheric detail. The world feels **lived-in, chaotic, and ripe for emergent problem-solving.**"
