When the animal is fully expanded out of its shell it is so large that it covers almost the entire shell and looks as if it couldn't possibly fit into the shell. Much of the expansion is due to the uptake of water, however, and if the animal is gently disturbed it will slowly release water from sinuses in the mantle and foot and contract into its shell, finally closing a horny operculum. It does not usually stay inside the shell long because it cannot breathe. It crawls across sandflats and mudflats with its huge foot partly extended in front of the shell like a snowplow, pushing through the sediments in search of clams. It may burrow at least 10 cm into the sand. Bivalve prey include Mya truncata,Tresus capax, Saxidomus gigantea, and Protothaca staminea clams but don't seem to seek out cockles Clinocardium nuttallii which are found in the same areas, probably because their shells are thicker. The moon snail can bore about 1/2 mm per day. Some clams are found with characteristic, \"countersunk\" drill holes through the shell made by the radula; while with others the snail seems to simply surround the clam with its enormous foot and wait until the clam suffocates enough to open up. Predators on Euspira lewisii include the sunflower star Pycnopodia helianthoides. It quickly withdraws its foot when it contacts Pycnopodia. Enteroctopus dofleini may be another predator, and the moon snails themselves may sometimes be cannibalistic. Eggs are laid in a distinctive gelatinous coil or collar shaped as if it were formed around the top of a canning jar. The egg mass is a firm gelatin with thousands of embedded eggs. Sand is also embedded in the mass, giving it a sandy texture. The coil is left on the sand. Eggs hatch into free-swimming, nonfeeding veliger larvae in midsummer. Males are smaller than females, and females can live up to 14 years.\n\nShells from these snails are abundant in shell middens left by native Americans. The species can become toxic if they consume toxic clams during a red tide. They are also a favorite shell for large hermit crabs.\n\n\n\n© Rosario Beach Marine Laboratory\n\nSource: Invertebrates of the Salish Sea\n\nBelongs to 0 communities\n\nThis taxon hasn't been featured in any communities yet.\n\nLearn more about Communities\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "# **Moon Snail Research Station**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Theme:** A coastal marine biology research station specializing in the study of predatory mollusks, particularly the *Euspira lewisii* (Lewis's moon snail). The station is built partially over tidal flats, allowing direct observation and experimentation with live specimens.  \n\n**Core Collaboration Challenge:** Researchers must work together to handle large, fragile specimens, operate specialized equipment, and analyze ecological interactions in real time. The environment is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Heavy/Large Objects:** Tanks, sediment cores, and machinery require coordinated movement.  \n- **Delicate Procedures:** Handling live snails and clams demands precision and teamwork.  \n- **Dynamic Data Collection:** Multiple observation points (lab, field station, wet lab) require synchronized logging.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n1. **Tidal Observation Deck** – A wooden platform extending over mudflats, equipped with waterproof workstations and specimen collection tools.  \n2. **Wet Lab** – A semi-outdoor space with running seawater tanks, dissection stations, and microscope setups.  \n3. **Main Research Lab** – Climate-controlled, containing analytical equipment, computers, and specimen storage.  \n4. **Equipment Storage & Prep Room** – Houses diving gear, sediment samplers, and maintenance tools.  \n5. **Field Kitchen & Break Area** – A small, cluttered space with a coffee maker, mini-fridge, and pinned-up research notes.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Tidal Observation Deck**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **2m x 3m aluminum dissection table** (rusted at the legs, waterproof surface with drainage holes).  \n- A **heavy-duty winch system** (rated for 200kg, currently holding a submerged **sediment coring tube**).  \n- A **3-tier specimen rack** (holds 12 acrylic observation boxes, each with sand and seawater).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Live Moon Snail Tank** (60L, with a **partially buried specimen** covering its shell, foot extended).  \n- **Clam Bait Containers** (labeled *Mya truncata*, *Saxidomus gigantea*—one jar is **nearly empty**).  \n- **Radula Microscope Slide** (showing a **freshly extracted tooth**, sticky note: *\"Compare drill patterns?\"*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **digital salinity meter** (display flickering between 32-34 ppt).  \n- **Rubberized tool caddy** (holding forceps, calipers, a chipped **glass stirring rod**).  \n- **Stacked sediment sieves** (clogged with sand in the **medium mesh**).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **sun-bleached \"DANGER: BIOHAZARD\" sign** (peeling at the corners).  \n- A **sand-encrusted coffee thermos** (lid missing, half-full of cold brew).  \n- **Old shell middens** (discarded clam shells in a **woven basket**, some with **countersunk holes**).  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Wet Lab**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Recirculating Seawater System** (humming loudly, one **leaky valve** dripping into a bucket).  \n- **Steel Dissection Table** (stained with **purple dye** from a previous experiment).  \n- **Microscope Station** (with **dual eyepieces** for collaborative viewing).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Preserved Sunflower Star (*Pycnopodia helianthoides*)** (floating in a **cracked jar**, label smudged).  \n- **\"Toxic Specimen\" Fridge** (biohazard lock engaged, **red LED** blinking).  \n- **Egg Mass Sample** (gelatinous coil in a Petri dish, **embedded with sand grains**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Centrifuge** (lid slightly ajar, **error code E7** on display).  \n- **Pipette Rack** (one **P200** missing, sticky note: *\"Borrowed for tide samples\"*).  \n- **Saltwater Spray Bottle** (leaking onto a **stack of paper towels**).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Hermit Crab Photo** (caption: *\"Found in E. lewisii shell - 2022\"*).  \n- **Dusty Shell Collection** (on a high shelf, one **labeled \"Cannibal Specimen\"**).  \n- **Broken Glass Slide** (shards in a **small biohazard bag**).  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Sediment Corer Tube (150kg, 2m length)** – Requires two agents to operate the winch safely.  \n- **Live Snail Holding Tank (80L, fragile acrylic)** – Must be carried evenly to avoid stress cracks.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five chemical bottles**, only **one** has:  \n  - **Blue cap**  \n  - **Handwritten \"CORROSIVE\"**  \n  - **Half-empty (200mL remaining)**  \n  (Distractor: A **decorative blue glass paperweight** nearby increases misidentification risk.)  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **biohazard fridge** is locked.  \n  - **Solution:** The **keycard** is inside a **field notebook** in the break area.  \n  - **Obstacle:** The notebook is buried under **coffee-stained research papers**.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Notes:**  \nThis station is **alive with potential conflicts**—equipment failures, specimen handling risks, and time-sensitive observations. Agents must **navigate physical constraints, sensory distractions, and hidden dependencies** to succeed."
