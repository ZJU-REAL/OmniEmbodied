Even when the Oklahoma native wasn't at the hospital, she often had neither the energy nor the desire to run.\n\nThe health problems weren't hers.\n\nThey were her daughter's.\n\nLeVan's little girl was diagnosed last fall with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It's a disease that's every bit as awful as it sounds. If untreated, it can be fatal in only a few weeks.\n\n\"You just feel like your entire world has been pulled out from underneath you,” LeVan said of the diagnosis.\n\nMaddie, after all, is 4 years old.\n\nHow was LeVan supposed to keep training for the U.S. Olympic marathon trials?\n\nShe couldn't leave her daughter while doing 10- or 15-mile runs and logging hundreds of miles every month. She couldn't imagine how she could help Maddie get better and still find time to train.\n\nMaddie's trial had to come before hers.\n\nIndeed, it has been the priority, but early this morning in Boston, LeVan will toe the line for the start of the Olympic trials. She will try to turn a long-time dream into a fairy-tale reality.\n\nThe Casady School alum returned to running after missing about a month of vital training time. She didn't do it despite Maddie's leukemia. She did so because of it.\n\nThey have two trials.\n\n‘A mental game'\nEmily LeVan laughs when she talks about the things Maddie loves — dolls, dresses, dancing.\n\nThose are interests LeVan never had as a kid. Her passion was sports, and she played everything. Field hockey and track became her specialties at Casady, and she continued playing field hockey at Bowdoin College in Maine.\n\nAfter college, LeVan thought doing a marathon would be a fun challenge.\n\n\"Marathoning is such a mental game, so much more than any other sport I've ever done,” she said. \"You have to be able to maintain this focus on a daily basis over three or four months as you're training.”\n\nLeVan flourished under the pressure.\n\nIn her first marathon, she ran a time that qualified her for the granddaddy of them all, the Boston Marathon. Then a few years later, she qualified for the 2004 Olympic trials.\n\nA year before the trials, though, she learned she was pregnant. She would only have three months to train before the race.\n\nThat wasn't enough time.\n\n\"Oh,” LeVan joked with husband, Brad Johnson, \"there's always 2008.”\n\nNine months after giving birth to Maddie, LeVan ran a marathon. She felt good about her time and even better about her body.\n\nThe 2008 Olympic trials didn't seem so far-fetched.\n\n‘Worst nightmare'\nAs autumn turned to winter last year on the Maine coast, LeVan ramped up her training.\n\nOnly about six months remained until the trials, and everything was on schedule.\n\nContinue reading this story on the...\n\nby Jenni Carlson\n+ show more\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMarathoner Emily LeVan poses with her daughter Maddie near the finish line of the Olympic trial and Boston Marathon in Boston.

  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Pediatric Oncology Ward & Training Center Hybrid**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Scene Type:** A hybrid pediatric oncology ward and high-performance athlete training facility, designed to support both medical care and physical rehabilitation.  \n\n**Core Concept:** Inspired by Emily LeVan’s story, this environment merges the sterile precision of a hospital with the dynamic energy of an athlete’s training space. The scene is built around the tension between medical urgency and personal resilience—where young patients receive treatment while their caregivers (doctors, parents, therapists) balance emotional support with their own professional and personal demands.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Medical Collaboration:** Nurses, doctors, and lab technicians must coordinate on patient care, test analysis, and emergency protocols.  \n- **Family & Support Roles:** Parents, therapists, and athletic trainers interact in shared spaces, requiring careful scheduling and resource management.  \n- **Logistics & Maintenance:** Heavy equipment (MRI machines, treadmill rigs) and delicate medical supplies (IV drips, lab samples) necessitate teamwork for transport, setup, and troubleshooting.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n### **A. Main Ward & Patient Rooms**  \n- **Purpose:** Primary treatment zone for pediatric patients.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Brightly painted walls with murals of animals and athletes, but underscored by the hum of medical equipment.  \n- **Key Features:** Adjustable-height beds, IV stands, monitoring screens, and small play areas.  \n\n### **B. Rehabilitation Gym & Mini-Track**  \n- **Purpose:** A hybrid physical therapy and training space for recovering patients and athlete-parents.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Rubber-matted flooring, mirrored walls, and motivational posters (\"Every Step Counts!\").  \n- **Key Features:** Parallel bars, resistance bands, a 20m indoor track loop, and a water station.  \n\n### **C. Central Nurse’s Station**  \n- **Purpose:** Coordination hub for medical staff.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Organized chaos—clipboards, ringing phones, a whiteboard with patient updates.  \n- **Key Features:** A U-shaped counter with computers, a locked medication cabinet, and a printer spitting out lab results.  \n\n### **D. Lab & Diagnostics Room**  \n- **Purpose:** Bloodwork analysis, MRI scans, and medical record-keeping.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Cold fluorescence, the hum of centrifuges, and the faint smell of antiseptic.  \n- **Key Features:** A centrifuge (spinning at 3000 RPM), a microscope with slides labeled \"LYMPH-BLAST CASE 42,\" and a locked fridge with biohazard stickers.  \n\n### **E. Family Lounge / \"Parent-Training Nook\"**  \n- **Purpose:** A shared space where parents can rest, work, or train while staying close to their children.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Worn couches, a coffee machine (half-full pot, lukewarm), and a treadmill wedged in the corner.  \n- **Key Features:** A bulletin board with shift schedules, a shelf of donated books, and a small fridge with protein shakes labeled \"Maddie’s Mom – DO NOT TOUCH.\"  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Ward & Patient Rooms**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Adjustable pediatric beds (120cm length, IV pole attachment points).  \n- A large vitals monitor (displaying ECG, O2 levels, beeping intermittently).  \n- A mobile toy cart (wheels squeaky, half-filled with stuffed animals).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **IV drip stand (adjustable height, currently set to 110cm, bag ¾ full of clear fluid).**  \n- **Patient wristband (scannable barcode, reads \"MADDIE J – ALL B-TYPE\").**  \n- **Emergency call button (red, slightly sticky from juice residue).**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A rolling stool (height-adjustable, slightly wobbly).  \n- A sanitizer dispenser (90% full, lemon-scented).  \n- A whiteboard (scribbled with today’s nurse assignments).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A hand-drawn \"Get Well Soon\" card taped to the wall (crayon, smudged).  \n- A forgotten pacifier under the bed (clean but dusty).  \n- A framed photo of a marathon finish line (Emily LeVan, bib #208).  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Rehabilitation Gym & Mini-Track**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A curved rehab treadmill (max speed 12km/h, emergency stop cord dangling).  \n- Parallel bars (rubber grips worn down in the middle).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A medicine ball (5kg, slightly deflated, labeled \"PT USE ONLY\").**  \n- **A pulse oximeter (left on the bench, battery at 15%).**  \n- **A resistance band rack (colors coded by tension: red = heavy, missing blue band).**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A water cooler (empty jug, spare one unopened nearby).  \n- A wall clock (broken, stuck at 3:15).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A motivational poster (\"Pain is Temporary, Pride is Forever!\").  \n- A stray hair tie on the floor (purple, stretched out).  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Central Nurse’s Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A large L-shaped desk (scratched surface, two monitors).  \n- A locked narcotics cabinet (biometric scanner, beeps on failed attempt).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A printed lab report (highlighted values, \"WBC COUNT CRITICAL\").**  \n- **A misplaced patient file (stamped \"URGENT – ONCOLOGY REVIEW\").**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A ringing landline phone (caller ID: \"LAB – PRIORITY\").  \n- A coffee stain on the counter (dried, circular).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A \"World’s Best Nurse\" mug (chipped handle).  \n- A Post-it note: \"Reminder: Order more gauze.\"  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **MRI Machine Cart (Weight: 400kg, Dimensions: 2.5m x 1.8m)** – Requires two agents to maneuver without damaging sensitive components.  \n- **Protein Shake Fridge (Locked, Key in Nurse’s Drawer)** – Demands coordination between parent and staff for access.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five IV bags (all labeled with patient names), only **Maddie’s** has a **blue stripe** (indicating a specialized chemo drug). A nearby spilled juice cup adds urgency—agents must verify before administering.  \n- **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning:** The **broken wall clock** in the gym is stuck, but the **digital timer on the treadmill** (set to 30:00) provides an alternative. An agent must cross-reference both to track rehab durations accurately.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** This environment is a **living stage**, where every object tells a story—whether it’s a child’s forgotten toy or a parent’s hidden training log. The density of interactive and ambient elements ensures that AI agents must navigate not just tasks, but the emotional and logistical layers of caregiving, resilience, and teamwork."
