As seems most fitting, the peeps at Cobra are behind this one, and we must say that if this is your thing, the premise is pretty interesting: the handset, running a free app from the company, connects to the iCobra fuzz buster via Bluetooth and alerts the driver to things like cameras, commonly identified speed traps, rough intersections, and more. Suggested retail is $170, but we've seen it making the rounds for the $100 mark. Race your way to your favorite e-tailer to see for yourself.\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"The Cobra Command Surveillance Van\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA blacked-out surveillance van, retrofitted as a mobile tech hub for a private security team. The vehicle is designed for high-speed reconnaissance missions, blending law enforcement gear with hacker-like tech improvisation. The tight space necessitates **multi-agent coordination**—agents must navigate cluttered workstations, secure sensitive equipment, and manage real-time data feeds while the van is in motion.  \n\n**Why multi-agent?**  \n- **Physical constraints:** Heavy equipment requires multiple people to move.  \n- **Specialized roles:** One agent monitors radar/lidar detection, another handles comms, another secures loose gear.  \n- **Dynamic environment:** The van’s movement introduces instability (objects shift, wires disconnect).  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe van is divided into **four zones**, each with distinct functions:  \n\n### **A. Driver’s Cockpit**  \n- **Purpose:** Primary navigation and threat detection.  \n- **Features:** Reinforced dash with embedded touchscreens, a Cobra iRadar unit suction-cupped to the windshield, and a secondary Bluetooth-linked iPhone running detection software.  \n\n### **B. Tech Command Hub**  \n- **Purpose:** Real-time surveillance and data processing.  \n- **Features:** A fold-out workstation with multiple monitors, a rack of portable servers, and a wall-mounted whiteboard with scribbled GPS coordinates.  \n\n### **C. Gear Storage & Improvised Workshop**  \n- **Purpose:** Equipment storage and quick repairs.  \n- **Features:** Stacked Pelican cases, a makeshift soldering station, and a mini fridge stocked with energy drinks.  \n\n### **D. Rear Airlock (Entry/Exit Point)**  \n- **Purpose:** Secure entry and gear staging.  \n- **Features:** A sliding reinforced door, magnetic weapon racks, and a floor-mounted anchor point for rappelling gear.  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Driver’s Cockpit**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Custom driver’s seat** (hydraulic suspension, wear marks on the left armrest).  \n- **Dashboard console** (three embedded 10-inch touchscreens, one flickering intermittently).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Cobra iRadar detector** (Bluetooth-paired to an iPhone 4S with a cracked screen, running \"iCobra Alert v2.1\").  \n- **Police scanner** (digital, tuned to local frequencies, emitting static bursts).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Adjustable cup holder** (currently holding a half-empty coffee cup, lid askew).  \n- **Overhead CB radio mic** (swinging slightly from van movement).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Peeling \"NO EATING\" sticker** on the glove compartment.  \n- **Faded polaroid** taped to the sun visor (showing a blurry speed trap location).  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Tech Command Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Fold-out aluminum workstation** (bolted to the van wall, surface scratched from heavy use).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Server rack** (four blinking blade servers, one with an amber \"ERROR\" LED).  \n- **Encrypted laptop** (sticker: \"PROPERTY OF SHADOW OPS – DO NOT REMOVE\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Dual 24-inch monitors** (one displaying a live radar map, the other a scrolling IRC chat).  \n- **Wireless keyboard** (missing the \"W\" key).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Whiteboard** (half-erased scribbles: \"AVOID HWY 12 – LASER TRAP CONFIRMED\").  \n- **Chewed USB cable** (teeth marks near the connector).  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Gear Storage & Improvised Workshop**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty shelving unit** (bolted to the van wall, slightly bent from weight).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Pelican case (Model 1650)** (locked, contents: \"RF JAMMER – AUTHORIZED USE ONLY\").  \n- **Soldering iron** (still warm, resting on a charred wood block).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Mini fridge** (humming loudly, interior light flickering).  \n- **Tool pegboard** (missing a Phillips-head screwdriver).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Stack of old Wired magazines** (2010-2012 issues, dog-eared).  \n- **Dusty \"DEFCON 26\" lanyard** hanging from a hook.  \n\n---  \n\n### **D. Rear Airlock (Entry/Exit Point)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Sliding reinforced door** (scratches near the handle from hasty exits).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Magnetic weapon rack** (holding two disassembled rifles, one missing its stock).  \n- **Rappelling harness** (dangling from a ceiling hook, carabiner slightly rusted).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Floor anchor point** (threads slightly stripped from overuse).  \n- **First-aid kit** (partially open, gauze wrappers spilling out).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti-style \"FAST & QUIET\" stencil** on the wall.  \n- **Dried mud footprints** leading to the exit.  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Pelican case (RF Jammer)**: 25kg, requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Server rack unit**: 80kg, must be stabilized during van movement.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning**: Among five USB drives in the Tech Hub, only **one** has a red cap, a \"BACKUP_CRITICAL\" label, and is plugged into an unmarked port.  \n- **Compound Tool-Use**: The locked Pelican case requires a keycard (hidden under the driver’s seat) and a fingerprint scan (from the team leader’s glove compartment).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis environment is **dense with interactive potential**—every object has weight, function, and history. Agents must navigate shifting priorities, unstable conditions, and layered security measures, making **collaboration essential**."
