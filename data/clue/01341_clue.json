But it is a classically handsome shape in spite of the chrome prominently featured on the front grille (a bit glitzy for my taste). The outside mirrors conveniently fold in for squeezing the car in and out of tight parking spots. The entire body, mirrors included, is designed to reduce wind noise. I wasn't as concerned with wind noise as I was with getting blown around on a gusty day.\n\nThe top-of-the-line ES model I drove comes with air conditioning, 15-in. alloy wheels, and keyless remote with illuminated entry. The car is packaged with A/C, a CD stereo, and a laundry list of standard features to attract young buyers. This model rings in with a total price of $15,455.\n\nInside the car, tiny climate-control knobs were difficult to turn while driving, but the air conditioner itself pumps out cool air in no time. The wheel fit naturally in my hand with a solid feel. Dimpled plastic abounds in the interior, which, combined with a sparse dash panel, promotes a budget car feel. But there's no skimping on the seats. The seat height and angle are adjustable, and that makes a world of difference in a compact sedan.\n\nThe Protege also puts priority on interior space. Mazda has opened up backseat leg room by moving the mounting points of the front seat tracks from the floor to the side sills and transmission tunnel. And in the front, the lower portion of the instrument panel is slightly concave for extra knee room. The trunk also is spacious.\n\nThe ride is comfortable, but what won me over is the engine's purr and pounce. The car has more power than I expected, and it idles smoothly. The 1.8-liter engine is based on the 2.0 DOHC four-cylinder engine in Mazda's midsize 626 sedan. A 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine is optional. Fuel economy for the ES is rated at 26 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe Protege handles well. Front and rear stabilizer bars provide roll resistance Mazda equates to that found only in sports cars -- 2* of roll during 0.5-g cornering. To maintain a smooth ride, the shock absorbers use ultralow-speed valves.\n\nFor safety in a side impact or rollover, the Protege has what Mazda calls \"Triple-H\" construction. The first \"H\" includes the B-pillar, roof rail, and side sill on each side of the car; the second \"H\" is formed by the roof rails and roof cross member; and the third \"H\" comprises the side sills and third cross member. The car also has side-impact door beams, which eat a bit of interior space. And catch-pins on the rear doors prevent the door from entering the cabin in side impacts.\n\nThe Protege is a great match for a young person who needs to get around town on a budget but refuses to compromise the fun factor.\n\n--Elizabeth Parks\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Compact Urban Automotive Workshop**  \n\n## **Overall Scene Theme & Core Concept**  \nA bustling, slightly cramped **compact urban automotive workshop**, specializing in performance upgrades and repairs for small, sporty cars. The space is designed to maximize efficiency in tight quarters—mirroring the Mazda Protege’s balance of compactness and functionality. The workshop is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy, unwieldy objects** (engines, toolboxes) requiring multiple people to move.  \n- **Specialized tool dependencies** (certain tasks require tools stored in different areas).  \n- **Multi-step diagnostics & repairs** (e.g., verifying engine tuning while monitoring diagnostics on a separate terminal).  \n\nThe scene feels **lived-in**, with a mix of **organized chaos**—tools left mid-use, half-finished modifications, and a blend of high-tech diagnostics alongside old-school mechanical work.  \n\n---\n\n## **Spatial Layout & Area Descriptions**  \nThe workshop is divided into **four key zones**, each with distinct purpose and atmosphere:  \n\n1. **Main Garage Bay** – The primary workspace, housing a **lifted Mazda Protege ES (1999 model)**, mid-upgrade. Open tool carts, hydraulic lifts, and scattered parts create a sense of ongoing work.  \n2. **Parts & Tool Storage** – A **narrow shelving unit and wall-mounted tool racks**, densely packed with labeled bins, spare components, and specialty tools.  \n3. **Diagnostics & Computer Station** – A **cluttered desk** with a **diagnostic computer**, **oscilloscope**, and **printed wiring diagrams** taped to a corkboard.  \n4. **Break & Prep Area** – A small **coffee station** with a **microwave**, **mini-fridge**, and a **whiteboard** listing current jobs and deadlines.  \n\n---\n\n## **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main Garage Bay**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Hydraulic vehicle lift**, currently raised to waist height, supporting the **Protege ES** (color: **Deep Crystal Blue Mica**).  \n- **Rolling tool chest (1.2m tall, 80kg fully loaded)**, with **drawers labeled in grease-stained masking tape**.  \n- **Overhead fluorescent lights (one flickering intermittently)**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Disassembled 1.8L DOHC engine block (85kg, mounted on a wheeled stand)** – halfway through a performance rebuild.  \n- **Torque wrench (calibrated to 150 ft-lbs, set to \"click\" mode)** – left on the fender.  \n- **OBD-II scanner (plugged into the Protege’s port, screen displaying \"P0171 - System Too Lean\")**.  \n- **Polished chrome front grille (removed, leaning against a tire)**.  \n\n**c.
