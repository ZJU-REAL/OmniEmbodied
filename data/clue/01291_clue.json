(AP) -- It could cost more than $10,000 per year for in-state students to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison if a recommended tuition increase is approved.\n\nThe university's Board of Regents is scheduled to take up the proposed 5.5% tuition increase Thursday.\n\nThe Wisconsin State Journal reports it's the sixth straight year in which system President Kevin Reilly is recommending a 5.5% tuition increase for in-state students.\n\nThe regents can't raise tuition more than that due to a legislative cap.\n\nReilly calls the proposal a \"modest, predictable tuition increase\" that will provide additional revenue for campuses.\n\nIf the proposal is approved, out-of-state students would also see an increase in tuition and fees. It would cost a non-resident $26,096 to attend school at the Madison campus.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"University Budget Office Amidst Tuition Hike Deliberations\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling university budget office in the final hours before a critical Board of Regents vote on a proposed tuition hike. The room is a nexus of financial documents, policy discussions, and last-minute lobbying efforts, requiring coordination between administrators, analysts, and student representatives. The scene is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Distributed information** (documents scattered across rooms, locked files).  \n- **Physical constraints** (heavy boxes of records, secured cabinets).  \n- **Time pressure** (deadline-driven chaos, urgent document retrieval).  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe office suite consists of:  \n- **Main Conference Room** – A long mahogany table with 12 leather chairs, projector screens displaying tuition models.  \n- **Administrative Workroom** – Cluttered with financial reports, printers, and coffee-stained budget drafts.  \n- **Secure Records Annex** – A locked side room with filing cabinets and a heavy safe containing original regents’ meeting minutes.  \n- **Student Protest Hub (Outside)** – A hallway with a folding table covered in petitions, protest signs, and a disconnected landline phone.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Conference Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A 4-meter mahogany conference table with a scratched surface from years of use.  \n- A ceiling-mounted projector displaying a frozen PowerPoint slide: *\"5.5% Tuition Increase: Revenue Projections.\"*  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A red-stamped folder** labeled *\"APPROVED 2023-24 BUDGET – CONFIDENTIAL\"* (locked with a small combination padlock).  \n- **A wireless presentation clicker** with dead batteries, left beside an empty coffee cup.  \n- **A landline phone** off-hook, emitting a dial tone.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A water cooler** with a half-full jug and a stack of paper cups.  \n- **A wall clock** stuck at 2:17 PM (battery dead).  \n- **A whiteboard** with half-erased calculations: *\"$10,000 x 45,000 students = $450M.\"*  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Framed portraits of past university presidents (one slightly crooked).  \n- A wilting potted fern in the corner.  \n- A forgotten student protest flyer under a chair: *\"NO MORE HIKE – UW STUDENTS UNITED.\"*  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Administrative Workroom**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **large industrial printer** jammed with a crumpled page titled *\"Regents’ Vote Tally – DRAFT.\"*  \n- **A rolling cart** stacked with three banker’s boxes (labeled *\"2018-2022 Tuition Data – DO NOT DISCARD\"*).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A USB drive** labeled *\"Final Proposal Backup\"* left next to an open laptop.  \n- **A locked filing cabinet** (key missing) with a drawer slightly ajar, revealing a folder tab: *\"Student Aid Cuts – Draft.\"*  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A coffee maker** with a burnt carafe and a sticky \"OUT OF ORDER\" note.  \n- **A dented metal inbox** overflowing with unopened mail.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A faded OSHA safety poster about \"Proper Lifting Techniques.\"  \n- A chipped mug filled with dried-out pens.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Secure Records Annex**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A fireproof safe** (1.2m tall, 300kg) with a digital keypad (display: \"LOCKED – 2 ATTEMPTS REMAINING\").  \n- **A floor-to-ceiling metal shelving unit** holding archival boxes (some labeled *\"Student Loan Default Rates\"*).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A ring of keys** hanging on a pegboard (one tagged *\"MASTER – REGENTS’ FILES\"*).  \n- **A dusty ledger book** open to a page with handwritten notes: *\"Last hike: 5.5% – same as last 5 years?\"*  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A flickering fluorescent light** casting uneven shadows.  \n- **An old microfiche reader** covered by a dusty tarp.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Cobwebs in the corner near a vent.  \n- A vintage university seal plaque on the wall (tarnished).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The fireproof safe (300kg, 1.2m tall)** cannot be moved by one person—requires two agents to coordinate leverage.  \n- **The banker’s boxes (each 20kg, awkward shape)** are too heavy for a single person to carry up stairs.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five USB drives** on the workroom desk, only **one** has a red sticker and is labeled *\"Final Proposal Backup.\"* The others are blank or mislabeled.  \n  - The **correct key for the filing cabinet** is on the pegboard, but it’s mixed with **12 nearly identical keys**, only distinguishable by a tiny engraved \"R.\"  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The red-stamped folder is locked with a combination padlock.  \n  - **Solution:** The combination is written **on a sticky note inside a desk drawer in the workroom**, obscured under coffee stains.  \n  - **Distractor:** A **decoy sticky note** nearby reads *\"Combo: 12-34-56\"* (incorrect).  \n\nThis environment forces agents to:  \n- **Filter signal from noise** (correct vs. decoy documents).  \n- **Navigate physical constraints** (heavy objects, locked doors).  \n- **Interpret incomplete information** (handwritten notes, dead devices).  \n\nThe scene is **dense, purposeful, and atmospheric**, ensuring rich collaborative and reasoning-based tasks."
