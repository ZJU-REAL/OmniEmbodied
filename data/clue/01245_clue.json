Users can also lock the PCI Express bus between 100 and 150MHz and crank the CPU voltage up to 1.7V, which should keep most casual overclockers happy. CPU multiplier control even makes an appearance, but a lack of 0.5x multiplier steps will limit your ability to fine-tune the CPU clock speed.\n\nThe SL-K890PRO-939's memory tweaking options won't hold you back. While not the most extensive list of Athlon 64 memory timings we've seen in a BIOS, all of our favorites are there, including the all-important 1T command rate.\n\nUnfortunately, all the memory timings in the world can't make up for the BIOS's glaring lack of fan or temperature-based alarm and shutdown conditions. The BIOS doesn't manipulate fan speeds based on CPU or system temperatures, either.\n\nThe SL-K890PRO-939's BIOS can at least monitor temperatures, fan speeds, and voltages, although it doesn't do much with that information. Monitoring data can be passed to a Soltek-branded Windows monitoring app, but users can't actually manipulate BIOS variables with the software.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Overclocked Server Lab – A Race Against Thermal Meltdown\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-tech server lab undergoing emergency maintenance after a failed overclocking experiment. The room hums with the strain of overheating hardware, flickering LED indicators, and the acrid scent of ozone. The scene is inherently collaborative because:  \n- **Critical Time Pressure:** The servers must be stabilized before a thermal shutdown.  \n- **Physical Constraints:** Heavy server racks, tangled cables, and delicate components require multi-agent coordination.  \n- **Multi-Domain Expertise:** Some tasks require mechanical intervention (replacing cooling units), while others demand digital monitoring (adjusting BIOS settings).  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe lab is a rectangular space divided into **four key zones**:  \n1. **Main Server Cluster** – A central bank of towering server racks, some with open maintenance panels exposing circuitry.  \n2. **Diagnostic Workstation** – A cluttered desk with multiple monitors displaying temperature readouts and BIOS settings.  \n3. **Cooling & Maintenance Bay** – A side area with backup cooling units, spare parts, and tools.  \n4. **Storage & Documentation Corner** – Shelves of manuals, spare components, and archived hard drives.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Server Cluster**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Primary Server Rack (Model: \"X9000-Titan\")** – 2.2m tall, 150kg, with four open maintenance hatches exposing internal wiring.  \n- **Secondary Backup Rack (Model: \"Zeta-4U\")** – Smaller (1.5m tall, 80kg), but its cooling fans are visibly straining.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Failing Cooling Unit (No. 3)** – A liquid-cooling block with a cracked seal, leaking coolant onto the floor.  \n- **Overheated CPU Bank (Slot B2)** – A Ryzen Threadripper chip glowing amber under its heat spreader.  \n- **Exposed Power Distribution Board** – Missing a safety cover, with two loose 12V connectors dangling.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Network Switch (Cisco SG350-10)** – Blinking erratically, indicating packet loss.  \n- **KVM Console** – A keyboard-video-mouse switch with sticky keys (last cleaned months ago).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Employee of the Month\" Certificate (2019)** – Faded, pinned crookedly on the rack.  \n- **Stack of Anti-Static Mats** – Unused, covered in dust.  \n\n---\n\n#### **B. Diagnostic Workstation**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Triple-Monitor Setup** – Mounted on an ergonomic arm, showing real-time thermal graphs.  \n- **\"Emergency Procedures\" Whiteboard** – Half-erased, with a crude drawing of a fire extinguisher.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **BIOS Debug Terminal** – A Soltek-branded monitoring app running, but locked out from adjustments.  \n- **USB Security Dongle** – Required to unlock BIOS settings, currently plugged into a drawer below.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Thermal Camera (FLIR E4)** – Left on the desk, still warm from recent use.  \n- **Coffee Maker** – Cold, with a half-full carafe of day-old brew.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Sticky Note on Monitor** – Reads *\"DO NOT TOUCH FAN SETTINGS – Last guy fried the board.\"*  \n- **Assorted Screwdrivers** – Strewn about, none matching their labeled holder.  \n\n---\n\n#### **C. Cooling & Maintenance Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Spare Cooling Unit Rack** – Holds three backup liquid coolers (two functional, one missing tubing).  \n- **Tool Chest (Rolling, Red, 60kg)** – Locked, key taped underneath.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Replacement Cooling Block (Model: \"Hydro-X\")** – Still in its anti-static packaging.  \n- **Thermal Paste Tube (Arctic Silver 5)** – Half-used, crusty around the nozzle.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Air Compressor** – Plugged in but out of reach behind a stack of empty coolant bottles.  \n- **Oscilloscope (Tektronix TBS1052B)** – Powered off, covered in fingerprint smudges.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Safety First!\" Poster** – Peeling at the corners, ironically next to exposed wiring.  \n- **Dented Mini-Fridge** – Contains energy drinks and a moldy sandwich.  \n\n---\n\n#### **D. Storage & Documentation Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Shelving Unit** – Overloaded with mismatched server parts.  \n- **Filing Cabinet (Locked)** – Key hidden inside an old coffee mug on top.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Server BIOS Manual (Soltek SL-K890PRO-939)\"** – Bookmarked on the missing fan control section.  \n- **Box of Thermal Sensors** – One labeled *\"FAULTY – Gives false high readings.\"*  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label Maker (Brother PT-D210)** – Out of tape, last used to mislabel a box as \"Not Important.\"  \n- **Spare Power Cables** – Tangled in a bin, some with chewed ends (office cat?).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Rubber Duck (Wearing Sunglasses)** – Perched on a shelf, a debugging mascot.  \n- **\"Hackathon 2018\" Trophy** – Covered in dust, leaning precariously.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Primary Server Rack (150kg, 2.2m tall)** – Requires two agents to safely tilt for maintenance access.  \n- **Tool Chest (60kg, locked)** – One agent must retrieve the key while another holds it steady.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five coolant bottles, only **one is labeled \"For Emergency Use – Do NOT Mix with Standard Coolant.\"**  \n  - The **faulty thermal sensor** must be identified by cross-referencing its serial number with the manual.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The BIOS is locked out from fan adjustments.  \n  - **Solution:** The USB security dongle is hidden inside a drawer beneath the workstation.  \n  - **Additional Challenge:** The drawer is jammed and requires prying open with a flathead screwdriver.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes on Atmosphere & Realism**  \nThe lab is a **high-stakes, high-detail environment** where every object has history:  \n- **Sensory Clutter:** Flickering lights, the hum of strained fans, and the faint smell of burnt plastic.  \n- **\"Noise\" Objects:** The rubber duck, old coffee cups, and outdated manuals force agents to filter distractions.  \n- **Implied Backstory:** The faded \"Employee of the Month\" certificate and hackathon trophy suggest this was once a cutting-edge lab now running on duct tape and caffeine.  \n\nThis scene is **ripe for multi-agent problem-solving**, whether stabilizing servers, diagnosing BIOS failures, or preventing an actual fire."
