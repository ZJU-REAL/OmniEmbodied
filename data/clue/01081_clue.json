This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, pilot study compares two buprenorphine sublingual tablet dosing schedules to oral clonidine. Heroin users (N = 30) who met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence and achieved a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 13 (moderate withdrawal), were randomized to receive higher dose buprenorphine (HD, 8-8-8-4-2 mg/day on days 1-5), lower dose buprenorphine (LD, 2-4-8-4-2 mg/day on days 1-5), or clonidine (C, 0.2-0.3-0.3-0.2-0.1 mg QID on days 1-5). COWS scores were obtained QID. Twenty-four hours after randomization, the percentages of subjects who achieved suppression of withdrawal, as defined by four consecutive COWS scores <12, were: C = 11%, LD = 40%, and HD = 60%. Generalized estimating equation regression models, controlling for baseline COWS and time, indicated that COWS scores over the course of 5 days were lower in both LD and HD compared to C (chi(2)(2) = 13.28, P = 0.001). Similar analyses examining scores over time on the Adjective Rating Scale for Withdrawal (ARSW) and on a Visual Analog Scale of Opiate Craving (VAS) indicated an overall treatment effect on the VAS accounted for by a significant difference between HD and C, but no overall treatment effect on the ARSW. There were no discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events. Both HD and LD regimens are safe and efficacious treatment for opioid detoxification, but HD demonstrated superiority to C on a greater number of measures.\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"Detoxification Research Ward & Pharmacy Hub\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA **hospital research ward specializing in opioid detoxification**, designed for **clinical trials** and **patient monitoring**. The environment is inherently **multi-agent** due to the **high-stakes coordination** required between **medical staff, pharmacists, and research assistants**—each with distinct roles in patient care, drug administration, and data collection.  \n\n**Why does this scene demand collaboration?**  \n- **Heavy/restricted objects** require multiple agents (e.g., locked medicine cabinets, biohazard disposal units).  \n- **Precision tasks** (e.g., measuring dosages, monitoring vitals) may require one agent to stabilize while another operates.  \n- **Information asymmetry** (e.g., only the pharmacist has access to the drug log; only the nurse has the patient’s COWS scores).  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe research ward consists of **four interconnected zones**, each with a distinct function:  \n\n1. **Patient Monitoring Room** – Where subjects undergoing detox are observed (hospital beds, IV stands, vitals monitors).  \n2. **Pharmacy & Drug Prep Station** – A secured area with buprenorphine stock, clonidine vials, and dosage measurement tools.  \n3. **Research Data Hub** – Where COWS scores and patient logs are recorded (computers, whiteboards, filing cabinets).  \n4. **Staff Break Area** – A small lounge with lockers, coffee maker, and a bulletin board for shift schedules.  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Patient Monitoring Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Three adjustable hospital beds** (with railings, IV hooks, and electronic controls for tilt).  \n- **Vitals monitoring station** (a rolling cart with ECG, pulse oximeter, and BP cuff).  \n- **Biohazard disposal bin** (bolted to the wall, requires two people to unlock and replace).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sublingual buprenorphine tablets** (in blister packs, labeled **8mg/4mg/2mg** doses).  \n- **Clonidine oral solution** (in a locked drawer, requires a keycard from the pharmacy).  \n- **COWS score sheets** (clipboard at each bed, with carbon copies for research records).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **IV drip stands** (one is empty, another has a half-used saline bag).  \n- **Nurse call button** (one is slightly loose in its socket).  \n- **Digital wall clock** (showing 14:37, slightly out of sync with the computer timestamps).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded motivational poster** (\"Recovery is a Journey\").  \n- **Wilted potted plant** (on the windowsill, soil dry).  \n- **Scattered patient ID wristbands** (some blank, some with smudged ink).  \n\n---\n\n### **B. Pharmacy & Drug Prep Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty drug safe** (300kg, bolted to the floor, requires a pharmacist’s fingerprint + keycard).  \n- **Laminar flow hood** (for sterile drug prep, humming faintly).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Buprenorphine stock bottles** (one is **mislabeled**—blue cap instead of red).  \n- **Clonidine vials** (one is **cracked**, leaking slightly).  \n- **Electronic pill counter** (needs calibration—display flickers).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Mortar and pestle set** (for crushing tablets, slightly dusty).  \n- **Refrigerator** (containing placebo solutions, temperature display reads 5°C).  \n- **Glass-fronted cabinet** (holding syringes, but one drawer is jammed).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"DOUBLE-BLIND PROTOCOL\" reminder sticky note** (peeling off the wall).  \n- **Expired drug disposal logbook** (last entry two weeks old).  \n- **Coffee stain** (on the counter, partially wiped).  \n\n---\n\n### **C. Research Data Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Central workstation** (three monitors, one displaying COWS score trends).  \n- **Locked filing cabinet** (patient records, key kept in the break room).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Randomization binder** (listing patient assignments to HD/LD/C groups).  \n- **Broken printer** (out of paper, jammed with a half-printed ARSW form).  \n- **Whiteboard** (scribbled: \"DAY 3 - HD group showing 60% suppression\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Stapler** (low on staples).  \n- **USB drive** (left plugged in, labeled \"BACKUP_Jan\").  \n- **Landline phone** (off-hook, faint dial tone).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **University of Washington coffee mug** (chipped rim).  \n- **Stacks of DSM-IV manuals** (one bookmarked at \"Opioid Dependence\").  \n- **Dusty framed certificate** (\"Veterans Affairs Research Excellence Award\").  \n\n---\n\n### **D. Staff Break Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Lockers** (one is slightly ajar, a lab coat sleeve caught in the door).  \n- **Microwave** (display stuck at 00:01).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Shift schedule clipboard** (someone has scribbled \"Dr. Kim covering B Ward\").  \n- **Lost keycard** (stuck under the fridge, barely visible).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Half-full coffee pot** (cold, with a film on top).  \n- **Squeaky rolling chair** (one wheel wobbles).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Torn \"Happy Retirement!\" banner** (hanging lopsided).  \n- **Scattered sugar packets** (spilled near the trash).  \n\n---\n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Biohazard disposal bin** (bolted shut, requires two people to lift and replace).  \n- **Drug safe** (300kg, impossible to move alone; requires coordination to access).  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five buprenorphine bottles**, only **one** has a **blue cap, handwritten \"CORROSIVE\" label, and is half-empty**—distinct from the red-capped ones.  \n  - **Distractor:** A decorative blue glass paperweight in the research hub could confuse agents unless they check the label.  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **clonidine vial is cracked and leaking**.  \n  - **Solution:** The **spare vial is in the locked fridge**, requiring the **keycard under the break room fridge** to retrieve it.  \n\n### **Dynamic State Problems**  \n- **Broken printer** (needs paper reload + jam cleared).  \n- **Mislabeled buprenorphine bottle** (agents must cross-check the randomization binder to confirm dosage).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Note:**  \nThis scene is **dense with interactive potential**, forcing agents to **navigate physical constraints, information asymmetry, and dynamic tool-use challenges**—all while maintaining the **realistic clutter** of a working medical research ward."
