The GeForce creator has been the repeated target of Rambus before and is still facing legal action despite reaching settlements over some patent claims.\n\nAs a companion to the lawsuits, Rambus has also put in a request for a ban at the International Trade Commission that would ban the import of any devices whose components use the patents, ranging from cellphones to hard drives, network routers and set-top boxes. It would likely also ban at least some of NVIDIA's graphics technology.\n\nMost ITC complaints are filed in the hopes of getting an early determination on patent validity to prevent it from being an issue in a longer-running trial and to potentially force a settlement.\n\nAlthough Rambus still has a significant number of customers for its memory, the company for over 10 years has been basing a disproportionately large amount of its business on suing other companies and collecting royalties. It has been accused of knowingly joining the JEDEC body for memory standards and using information collected there to patent technologies it could then use to extract licensing payments from others.\n\nCompanies are likely to negotiate settlements rather than risk an outright ban, but the lawsuits could raise the prices of many pieces of electronics in the US, focusing most on the mobile devices that use chipsets from Broadcom, Freescale and STMicro.\n\nBy Electronista Staff\n\n\n  1.

The high price made it undesirable and it just about went under. This company is nothing more than rotten/rusty skeletons and propped open by lawyers who agree to take a cut on the settlements. We'll see who has more money to drag on.\n\nLogin Here\n\n\n\nNetwork Headlines\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\nRecent Reviews\n\nDoxieGo Portable Scanner\n\n\nDell AD211 Bluetooth speaker\n\n\nVisionTek 128GB USB Pocket SSD\n\n\n\n\nMost Commented\n\n\nPopular News\n",
  "response": "# **High-Tech Patent Law Office Scene Concept**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling, high-pressure **patent law office** specializing in tech litigation. The scene revolves around a critical **legal emergency**: a major client (a semiconductor company) is facing an injunction threat from a notorious patent troll (inspired by Rambus). The law team must rapidly compile evidence, analyze technical documents, and prepare a defense—requiring tight coordination between **lawyers, paralegals, and tech consultants**.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Collaborative Document Handling:** Heavy case files, locked cabinets, and fragile electronics require teamwork.  \n- **Technical Analysis:** Lawyers need engineers to verify patent claims using schematics and lab equipment.  \n- **Urgent Time Pressure:** The ITC hearing is in **24 hours**, forcing rapid, parallel task execution.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n### **A. Main Conference Room (War Room)**  \n- **Purpose:** Strategy meetings, evidence organization.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Tense, with a massive whiteboard covered in legal arguments, patent diagrams, and sticky notes.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - A 12-seat **mahogany conference table** with embedded power outlets.  \n  - A **wall-mounted 85-inch OLED screen** displaying a countdown to the hearing.  \n  - **Soundproof glass walls** overlooking the city skyline.  \n\n### **B. Senior Partner’s Office**  \n- **Purpose:** Secure document storage, high-stakes decision-making.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Opulent but chaotic—a mix of luxury and last-minute panic.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - A **handcrafted walnut executive desk** with biometric locks.  \n  - A **floor-to-ceiling bookcase** of legal precedents, some visibly bookmarked.  \n  - A **hidden wall safe** (digital keypad) containing confidential client files.  \n\n### **C. Tech Analysis Lab**  \n- **Purpose:** Reverse-engineering competitor hardware for patent defense.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Cluttered, with humming servers and the faint smell of ozone.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - A **microscope station** for inspecting chip layouts.  \n  - A **disassembled GPU** (NVIDIA reference design) under forensic analysis.  \n  - A **wall of prototype DDR RAM modules** in labeled anti-static bags.  \n\n### **D. Paralegal Workstation Cluster**  \n- **Purpose:** Document digitization, evidence cataloging.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Organized chaos—stacks of paper, flickering monitors.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - **Four adjustable-height desks** with dual monitors.  \n  - A **high-speed document scanner** (jammed, with a blinking error light).  \n  - **Overflowing banker’s boxes** labeled *\"Rambus Litigation - 2010-2023.\"*  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Conference Room**  \n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Mahogany conference table** (3m x 1.5m, weight: 250kg—requires 2+ agents to move).  \n- **OLED display panel** (wall-mounted, showing a live legal document with tracked changes).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Case File Dossier** (25cm thick, bound in red leather, containing **printed patent claims** with highlighted sections).  \n- **Locked Evidence Briefcase** (fingerprint scanner, contains a prototype DDR5 module).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Wireless presentation clicker** (low battery, LED blinking red).  \n- **Conference phone** (on hold, soft hold music audible).  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Framed newspaper clippings** (\"Rambus Loses Key Patent Case – 2012\").  \n- **A wilting ficus plant** in the corner (one yellowing leaf on the floor).  \n\n### **B. Senior Partner’s Office**  \n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Walnut executive desk** (2.4m wide, biometric locks on drawers).  \n- **Floor safe** (digital keypad, concealed behind a painting of a gavel).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Encrypted USB drive** (labeled *\"DO NOT LOSE – ITC RESPONSE DRAFT\"*).  \n- **Handwritten legal pad** (page torn out, only corner remaining).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Leather chair** (slightly scuffed on one arm).  \n- **Desk lamp** (adjustable, currently angled toward a document).  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Awards shelf** (dusty \"Top 100 Lawyers\" plaque from 2015).  \n- **Family photo** (slightly crooked in its frame).  \n\n### **C. Tech Analysis Lab**  \n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Electrostatic discharge (ESD) workbench** (grounded, with wrist straps).  \n- **Server rack** (running a patent database search).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Disassembled GPU** (thermal paste still fresh, screws missing).  \n- **Oscilloscope** (displaying a waveform labeled *\"Rambus DDR3 vs. JEDEC\"*).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Anti-static bags** (some empty, some containing RAM chips).  \n- **Soldering iron** (cold, but residue on the tip).  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Whiteboard** (half-erased, with *\"Prior Art???\"* circled aggressively).  \n- **Coffee stain** (dried, on a schematics printout).  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Mahogany Conference Table (250kg, 3m long)** – Requires **two agents** to reposition.  \n- **Banker’s Boxes (20kg each, stacked 5 high)** – Paralegals must coordinate to access lower files.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five USB drives** on the senior partner's desk, only **one** is:  \n    - **Encrypted** (gold casing, no label).  \n    - The **correct one** is hidden under a **coffee-stained legal pad**.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **evidence briefcase** is locked (fingerprint scanner).  \n  - **Solution:** The **partner’s fingerprint** is on a **wine glass** in their office.  \n  - **Distractor:** A **decorative glass paperweight** also has smudges.  \n\n### **Dynamic Task Potential**  \n- **Repair the jammed document scanner** (requires finding a replacement roller in the supply closet).  \n- **Cross-reference patent filings** (needs both a **lawyer (legal knowledge)** and an **engineer (technical analysis)**).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes on Density & Realism**  \n- **Every object has a backstory** (e.g., the wilting plant implies neglect due to the case's urgency).  \n- **Functional clutter** (coffee stains, sticky notes) forces agents to **filter signal from noise**.  \n- **Multi-disciplinary collaboration** is **mandatory**—no single agent has all required skills.  \n\nThis scene is a **pressure cooker of collaboration**, where **legal strategy meets forensic tech work** in a race against the clock."
