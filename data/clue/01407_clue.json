  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Forensic Psychology Research Lab\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThe Forensic Psychology Research Lab is a high-stakes, multidisciplinary workspace where behavioral analysts, forensic technicians, and AI researchers collaborate to decode patterns of deception, emotional triggers, and decision-making in human subjects. The lab is designed to simulate real-world interrogation environments while simultaneously functioning as a cutting-edge research facility.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment Handling:** Some forensic tools require multiple agents to maneuver.  \n- **Distributed Expertise:** Different roles (analyst, technician, researcher) must coordinate.  \n- **Time-Sensitive Tasks:** Evidence processing, data cross-referencing, and real-time monitoring demand teamwork.  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe lab is divided into four interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Observation & Control Room** – A glass-paneled hub with live feeds from interrogation rooms.  \n2. **Forensic Analysis Bay** – A cluttered workstation for evidence processing.  \n3. **Behavioral Testing Chamber** – A staged \"living room\" with hidden sensors, simulating a domestic setting.  \n4. **Data Server & Storage Closet** – A cramped, cold room housing servers and archived case files.  \n\n#### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Observation & Control Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Central Monitoring Desk** – A U-shaped console with three adjustable chairs, embedded with touchscreens displaying live feeds.  \n- **One-Way Mirror Wall** – Reinforced glass separating the observation room from the testing chamber.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Voice Stress Analyzer** – A standalone device with a blinking \"CALIBRATION REQUIRED\" light.  \n- **Biometric Overlay Tablet** – Displays real-time pulse, pupil dilation, and micro-expression data from test subjects.  \n- **Emergency Shutdown Switch** – A red button under a protective flip cover, labeled \"TEST TERMINATION.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Adjustable Desk Lamps** – Articulated arms with dimmable LED panels.  \n- **Coffee Station** – Half-full pot, a chipped \"World’s Best Analyst\" mug, sugar packets scattered.  \n- **Wall-Mounted Whiteboard** – Scribbled with case IDs and behavioral hypotheses in dry-erase marker.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Degrees & Certifications** – Slightly crooked on the wall.  \n- **Faded \"Confidentiality Required\" Poster** – Peeling at the corners.  \n- **Sticky Notes** – Random reminders like \"Check calibration\" and \"Call IT re: server lag.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Forensic Analysis Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Microscope Workstation** – A heavy, vibration-dampened steel table with embedded lighting.  \n- **Evidence Locker** – A biometric-secured cabinet with a digital keypad (currently unlocked, beeping softly).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **DNA Sequencer** – Status screen reads \"ERROR: SAMPLE CONTAMINATION.\"  \n- **Fingerprint Dusting Kit** – Open, with black powder spilled on the counter.  \n- **Sealed Evidence Bag** – Labeled \"SUBJECT #7 - TEXT MESSAGE LOGS.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Centrifuge** – Humming faintly, lid slightly ajar.  \n- **Label Maker** – Out of tape, blinking \"RELOAD\" light.  \n- **Adjustable Task Chair** – Hydraulic lift stuck in mid-height position.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Stack of Old Case Files** – Tilted precariously on a shelf.  \n- **Dead Plant** – A wilted peace lily in a cracked ceramic pot.  \n- **Coffee Stain** – Dried, ring-shaped mark on the laminate counter.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Behavioral Testing Chamber**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Staged Living Room Set** – Sofa, coffee table, armchair (embedded with pressure sensors).  \n- **Hidden Camera Array** – Tiny lenses disguised as wall decor.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Digital Recorder** – Left on the coffee table, battery at 12%.  \n- **\"Casual\" Props** – A half-finished crossword puzzle, a cold cup of tea.  \n- **Trigger Object** – A wedding photo turned face-down.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Bookshelf** – Mostly filled with generic titles, but one book (\"The Art of Deception\") is slightly pulled out.  \n- **Wall Clock** – Ticking loudly, slightly fast (shows 3:07 PM, actual time 3:03 PM).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Dusty Vinyl Record Player** – Unplugged, needle resting off the platter.  \n- **Framed Abstract Art** – A slightly crooked painting of vague shapes.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Data Server & Storage Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Server Rack** – Heavy, bolted to the floor, with blinking status LEDs.  \n- **Overflowing Filing Cabinet** – Drawer 3 is jammed halfway open.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Backup Hard Drive** – Labeled \"ARCHIVE - DO NOT DELETE,\" sitting precariously on the edge of a shelf.  \n- **Broken Label Printer** – Error message: \"PAPER JAM - OPEN COVER.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Emergency Flashlight** – Mounted on the wall, battery dead.  \n- **Spare Cables** – Tangled in a milk crate.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated Safety Manual** – From 2015, covered in dust.  \n- **Abandoned Coffee Cup** – With a dried-up mold ring inside.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Server Rack (150kg, 2m tall)** – Requires two agents to slide out for maintenance.  \n- **Evidence Locker (biometric + keycard dual-auth)** – One agent must hold the door while another swipes the keycard.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five chemical bottles in the forensic bay, only **one** has a **blue cap, handwritten \"CORROSIVE\" label, and is half-full.** However, a decorative blue glass paperweight on the desk adds perceptual noise.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The DNA sequencer shows \"ERROR: SAMPLE CONTAMINATION.\"  \n  - **Solution:** The **sterilization spray** is inside the locked supply closet (keycard in the analyst’s desk).  \n\nThis dense, purposefully cluttered environment forces agents to navigate noise, collaborate on heavy objects, and solve multi-step puzzles—just like a real forensic investigation."
