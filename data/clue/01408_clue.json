Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** A meticulously detailed, moderately bustling **small-town post office** with an attached backroom sorting area and a private office. The environment is inherently suited for multi-agent collaboration due to its combination of **customer service tasks (requiring human-agent interaction), logistical operations (sorting, handling packages), and security protocols (fraud detection, package inspection).**  \n\n**Core Challenge & Story:** The post office is in the midst of a **suspected sweepstakes fraud case**, with clues scattered throughout the environment—misleading letters, intercepted packages, and a distraught elderly customer who may be a victim. Agents must work together to **identify fraudulent mail, assist vulnerable customers, and prevent financial loss** while maintaining daily postal operations.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe post office consists of three main areas:  \n\n1. **Front Counter & Customer Lobby** – The public-facing zone with service windows, self-service kiosks, and a waiting area. Filled with customers, some agitated, some confused.  \n2. **Backroom Sorting Hub** – A tightly packed logistics workspace with conveyor belts, sorting bins, and package processing stations.  \n3. **Postmaster’s Office** – A small but cluttered administrative room with surveillance monitors, case files, and intercepted suspicious mail.  \n\n---\n\n### **3.
