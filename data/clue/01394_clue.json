You need to travel to Leyawiin, enter the Blackwood Company building, locate the Hist Tree and destroy it. Oreyn warns that leader of the company, Ri'Zakar, will have the tree well-guarded, so don't expect a warm welcome. Prepare well before entering the Blackwood Company hall, as you will be attacked by the guild members in the hall almost instantly.\n\nFirst, you'll need to kill Ja'Fazir and retrieve Jeetum-Ze's Room Key from him. Jeetum-Ze holds the key to the Ri'Zakar's room, so you'll have to kill him first. Jeetum-Ze's room is on the second floor of the main hall. Kill Jeetum-Ze and remove Ri'Zakar's Key from his corpse. Ri'Zakar's room is on the top level of the hall. Make your way up to Ri'Zakar's room, kill him, and remove the 'Blackwood Co. Basement Key' from his corpse.\n\nKill Ri'Zakar, as he holds the Blackwood Co. Basement Key.\n\nWhen you have this key, head back down to the main floor and locate the door marked 'Blackwood Company Hall Basement.' The Hist Tree is through here. It would be wise to save your game before heading through the door.\n\nOnce in the basement, you'll need to destroy the machinery surrounding the Hist Tree. First, kill the two Blackwood Company members in this room. Then, head to the side of the room opposite the door used to enter the basement. Pick up the two loose pipes on the table here. Then, approach the nearby Sap Pump and press the A/X button when prompted to jam one of the pipes between the cogs, effectively breaking the machine. Approach the Sap Pump on the opposite side of the tree and do the same.\n\nDestroying both of the sap pumps will cause the Hist Tree to go up in flames. With that done, head back up the stairs and start toward the front entrance. You'll run into one more enemy before leaving guild hall. It's Maglir; you have no choice but to kill him.\n\nSabotage the two sap pumps by the Hist Tree to set it aflame.\n\nReturn to Chorrol, speak to Modryn Oreyn and tell him of your success. He'll give you the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw as a reward. Next, head to the Fighters Guild hall in Chorrol and speak to Vilena Donton there. Once you've explained what has happened, speak to her about your advancement to be promoted to Master of the Fighters Guild!\n\nSelect the 'Duties' dialogue option and appoint Modryn Oreyn as your second-in-command. Speak to Modryn Oreyn, who is unconvincingly reluctant to rejoin the Fighters Guild as your second-in-command.\n\nAs the Master of the Fighters Guild, you are able to assign duties to the guild once a month. Speak to Modryn Oreyn, and you can choose to have the guild focus on recruitment, contracts, or both. Choosing to focus on recruitment yields a better chance of having items delivered to the Guildmaster's chest on the top floor of the Fighters Guild hall in Chorrol. Choosing to focus on completing contracts will have money delivered to the chest instead, while focusing on both yields will yield items and a small amount of gold. \n\n\nComments for 19: The Hist\n\n\n\nAdd a comment\n\n\nCharacters left: 1000\n\nBB Codes Guide\n",
  "response": "# **Arboreal Research Station - Scene Concept**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA clandestine **Arboreal Research Station**, hidden deep within a dense jungle, where scientists study the enigmatic **Hist Sap**—a rare, sentient plant extract with potent psychoactive properties. The facility is a hybrid of **biotech lab**, **cult-like headquarters**, and **industrial processing plant**, designed for both scientific inquiry and covert operations.  \n\nThis environment is inherently **multi-agent** due to:  \n- **Heavy machinery** requiring coordinated operation.  \n- **Security protocols** demanding synchronized actions (keycards, biometric scanners).  \n- **Fragile biological samples** needing careful transport.  \n- **Sabotage potential** (pipes to jam, valves to close, data to erase).  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n### **A. Main Hall (Entry Point)**  \nA dimly lit foyer with **flickering fluorescent lights**, **jungle humidity seeping through cracked walls**, and a **security checkpoint** manned by an idle guard station. A **staircase** leads up to restricted areas, while a **reinforced basement door** hints at deeper secrets.  \n\n### **B. Research Lab (Left Wing)**  \nA sterile yet chaotic workspace with **microscopes**, **centrifuges**, and **racks of Hist Sap vials** (some glowing faintly, others inert). A **whiteboard** details cryptic chemical formulas, half-erased.  \n\n### **C. Sap Processing Room (Basement Access)**  \nThe heart of the operation—a **massive Hist Tree**, its roots intertwined with **industrial sap pumps**. Two **overloaded control panels** hum ominously. The air is thick with a **sweet, cloying scent**.  \n\n### **D. Security Office (Upper Floor)**  \nA cramped room with **monitors displaying live feeds**, a **locked weapons cabinet**, and a **disorganized desk** strewn with keycards and coffee-stained reports.  \n\n### **E. Storage & Maintenance (Adjacent to Lab)**  \nCluttered with **crates of supplies**, **broken equipment**, and **hastily discarded hazmat suits**. A **leaking pipe** drips fluorescent-green fluid into a rusted drain.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Reception desk** (chipboard, scratched surface, outdated computer).  \n- **Metal detector archway** (power light flickering).  \n- **Bulletin board** (peeling \"Safety Protocol\" posters, faded missing-person notices).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Guard’s keycard** (dangling from a lanyard on a hook).  \n- **Biometric scanner** (requires fingerprint override).  \n- **Broken ceiling fan** (sparking, could short-circuit if tampered with).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Security monitors** (showing static on 2/4 screens).  \n- **Visitor logbook** (last entry smudged).  \n- **Fire extinguisher** (expired, rust forming at nozzle).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Dead potted fern** (brittle leaves crumbling).  \n- **Coffee stains** (dried, radiating from a half-empty mug).  \n- **Peeling wallpaper** (revealing damp patches).  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Research Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Lab bench** (stainless steel, stained with chemical burns).  \n- **Fume hood** (glass cracked, warning light blinking).  \n- **Refrigerated sample storage** (humming loudly, temperature display flickering).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Hist Sap vials** (labeled with serial numbers, one marked \"VOLATILE\" in red).  \n- **Centrifuge** (lid jammed, requires two agents to force open).  \n- **Digital research terminal** (password protected, hint: \"Ri’Zakar’s favorite flower\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Autoclave** (cycle complete, steam hissing).  \n- **Microscope** (lens cracked, still operational).  \n- **Pipette set** (one missing, leaving an empty stand slot).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee ring stains** (on lab notes).  \n- **Dust-coated safety goggles** (discarded on a shelf).  \n- **Outdated calendar** (still on last month’s page).  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Sap Processing Room (Basement)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Hist Tree** (pulsing faintly, roots entwined with pipes).  \n- **Sap Pump A & B** (overheating, pressure gauges in the red).  \n- **Industrial control panel** (warning: \"OVERLOAD IMMINENT\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Loose metal pipes** (on a workbench, perfect for jamming machinery).  \n- **Emergency shutoff valve** (rusted, requires two people to turn).  \n- **Sap collection vat** (full, bubbling ominously).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Toolbox** (wrench missing, screwdriver present).  \n- **Steam vents** (hissing periodically).  \n- **Drip tray** (overflowing with viscous sap).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti on the wall** (\"The Hist Watches\").  \n- **Cracked safety helmet** (discarded near the door).  \n- **Abandoned clipboard** (sap-stained, illegible notes).  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Sap Collection Vat (200kg, 1.5m tall)** – Requires two agents to tip over.  \n- **Centrifuge Lid (jammed, 30kg resistance)** – Needs synchronized force to open.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five Hist Sap vials**, only one is **VOLATILE** (blue-labeled, half-full, slight glow). The presence of **decorative blue glass beakers** nearby increases misidentification risk.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **basement door is locked** (needs keycard + biometric scan).  \n  - **Solution:** **Keycard** is in the **guard’s lanyard**, but the **biometric scanner** requires a **fingerprint from Ri’Zakar’s corpse** (upstairs).  \n\nThis scene is **ripe for sabotage, rescue ops, or heists**, with **dynamic obstacles** (steam vents, sparking wires) and **hidden interactions** (loose pipes for jamming, volatile chemicals for diversionary explosions). Every object has **purpose**, every detail **matters**, and collaboration is **mandatory**.  \n\n**Final Note:** The Hist still watches. *Always.*"
