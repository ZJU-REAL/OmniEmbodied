And when you take its medal count per capita, it's not such a great haul.\n\nIn fact, Team Russia won just 0.23 medals per million Russians, which wouldn't even put the host nation in the top 10 on the medal table.\n\nBut if you consider the size of the countries competing, some smaller nations would rocket into the standings.\n\nThe Czech Republic's eight medals would put them in eighth place, with 0.76 medals per million Czechs.\n\nFinland's five medals would earn the nation seventh place, since there are only 5.4 million Finns.\n\nTiny Latvia would shoot up to joint third place with Austria, each country managing to bring home two medals per million citizens.\n\nMighty Canada would tumble down to ninth place, its 25 medals averaging out to 0.72 medals per million Canadians.\n\nBut Team USA would fall much farther than Canada. There are about 314 million Americans, so the country's 28-medal total works out to 0.09 medals per million people -- below South Korea and Poland, each of which claimed 0.16 medals per million.\n\nWho comes out top of the medal table per capita?\n\nThe answer won't surprise veteran Winter Olympics fans: One small country is already the most successful nation in Winter Olympic history, claiming the largest number of gold medals and the largest number of medals overall. This year, there was even an event (a women's cross-country ski race) where all three medals went to that country.\n\nIt is, of course, Norway, which took home 26 medals from Sochi, the third-highest medal total overall. Only Russia and the United States had a larger haul.\n\nBut Norway has only 5 million people. That means it claimed 5.2 medals per million, far more than Russia and the Americans, and knocking little Slovenia into second place, with four medals per million.\n\nHere's the whole top 10 (actually 11) Sochi Games medal based on population size:\n\n1. Norway 5.2 medals per million people\n\n2. Slovenia 4.0\n\n=3. Latvia 2.0\n\n=3. Austria 2.0\n\n4. Sweden 1.58\n\n5. Netherlands 1.43\n\n6. Switzerland 1.38\n\n7. Finland 0.93\n\n8. Czech Republic 0.76\n\n9. Canada 0.72\n\n10. Belarus 0.63\n\nPopulation source: World Bank, 2012 \n\nComments News Comments\n\nPost new Comment\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Title:** *The \"Micro-Olympics\" Training Facility*  \n\n**Core Concept:** A high-tech, modular training center designed for small nations to maximize their Olympic potential through intensive, collaborative preparation. The facility is a hyper-efficient, multi-disciplinary hub where athletes, coaches, and support staff work in tight coordination—mirroring the per-capita excellence of nations like Norway in the Winter Olympics.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Shared Resources:** Athletes from different disciplines must share specialized equipment.  \n- **Precision Timing:** Synchronized training schedules require real-time adjustments between agents.  \n- **Equipment Logistics:** Heavy or delicate gear requires multiple people to transport or operate safely.  \n- **Data-Driven Adjustments:** Coaches, analysts, and athletes must collaborate to optimize performance.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n1. **Main Training Hall**  \n   - A large, temperature-controlled space with modular flooring (ice, synthetic track, and rubberized zones).  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Hum of refrigeration units, faint smell of rubber and disinfectant, LED lighting tuned to minimize glare.  \n\n2. **Sports Science Lab**  \n   - A glass-walled monitoring room filled with biometric displays, motion-capture rigs, and recovery pods.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Low blue lighting from screens, quiet whir of servers, sterile scent of alcohol wipes.  \n\n3. **Equipment Storage & Maintenance Bay**  \n   - A high-density storage zone with labeled racks, tool benches, and diagnostic stations for gear upkeep.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Metallic tang of lubricants, faint ozone from welding equipment, cluttered but organized.  \n\n4. **Athlete Briefing Lounge**  \n   - A cozy but functional space with a smart whiteboard, ergonomic seating, and a hydration station.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Warm lighting, faint coffee aroma, motivational posters of past Olympic underdogs.  \n\n5. **Cold Recovery Chamber**  \n   - A cryotherapy pod room with temperature controls, towels, and emergency alert buttons.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Dry, frigid air, low hum of compressors, faint condensation on metal handles.  \n\n6. **Outdoor Simulation Track (Adjacent to Main Hall)**  \n   - A dynamic surface that mimics snow, ice, or gravel, with embedded sensors for gait analysis.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Wind machine noise, occasional spray of artificial snow, LED \"sunlight\" lamps.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Training Hall**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Modular Ice Rink (10m x 20m):** Adjustable temperature (-5°C to +3°C), embedded force sensors.  \n- **Olympic Lifting Platform:** Reinforced steel frame, rubber matting, weight racks (20–200kg).  \n- **Climbing Wall (4m x 6m):** Interchangeable holds, auto-belaying system with emergency cutoff.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Smart\" Speed Skates (Pair):** Bluetooth-connected, blade sharpness monitor (currently at 78%).  \n- **Obstacle Course Timer:** Laser-triggered, synced to athlete biometrics (currently paused).  \n- **Weighted Sled (150kg):** Too heavy for one person, requires two agents to move safely.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Hydration Station:** Touchless water dispenser, stack of biodegradable cups (half-empty).  \n- **First-Aid Kit:** Wall-mounted, fully stocked but with one bandage wrapper on the floor.  \n- **Adjustable Hurdles (Set of 5):** Lightweight aluminum, heights marked (30cm–90cm).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Medal Case:** Displaying replica Olympic medals from past underdog nations.  \n- **Dented Steel Water Bottle:** Left on a bench, sticker says \"TEAM SLOVENIA 2022.\"  \n- **Faded \"No Spikes on Ice\" Sign:** Hung crookedly near the rink entrance.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Sports Science Lab**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Motion-Capture Array (8-camera setup):** Calibration grid on the floor, slight flicker in one lens.  \n- **Biometric Monitoring Station:** Six screens showing live heart rate, muscle activation, and oxygen uptake.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Athlete Recovery Pod (1/4 occupied):** Currently set to -120°C, timer at 2:30 remaining.  \n- **\"Golden Sample\" Blood Test Kit:** Sealed, labeled \"URGENT – NORWAY SKI TEAM.\"  \n- **Calibration Weights (Set of 5):** Ranging from 100g to 5kg, one (2kg) misplaced on a chair.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Printer:** Out of paper, error light blinking.  \n- **Coffee Machine:** Half-full carafe, \"DO NOT TOUCH – COACHES ONLY\" note taped to it.  \n- **Whiteboard:** Scribbled equations, a sticky note reading \"FIX POD #3.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Stack of Old Data Tablets:** Dusty, one displaying a frozen error screen.  \n- **Fake Plant:** Plastic fern, slightly tilted in its pot.  \n- **\"Elite Performance\" Poster:** Faded, corner peeling off.  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The Weighted Sled (150kg, 2m long):** Requires two agents to lift without tipping.  \n- **Cryotherapy Pod Door (120kg, hydraulic hinge):** Stuck unless two agents apply simultaneous pressure.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five **calibration weights**, the 2kg one is misplaced—identified by its unique **scuffed blue paint** and **\"2.00kg\" engraving** (hidden under a clipboard).  \n  - The **\"Golden Sample\" blood kit** must be located among nearly identical kits by its **red priority stripe** and **Norwegian flag sticker**.  \n\n- **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **recovery pod is stuck** (error code E-47).  \n  - **Solution:** The **maintenance manual** (in the equipment bay) lists this as a **coolant valve issue**, requiring a **specific torque wrench** (stored in a locked toolbox—key is in the head coach’s desk).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis environment is **dense with intentional interactivity**, where every object has **multiple potential uses** and **collaboration is structurally necessary**. The **clutter of ambient objects** (like the misplaced weights or dusty tablets) adds realism, forcing agents to **filter signal from noise**—just like in a real high-stakes training facility.  \n\n**Potential Task Seeds:**  \n- **\"Two agents must calibrate the motion-capture system using the scattered weights.\"**  \n- **\"Retrieve the 'Golden Sample' before it expires, but the lab door is jammed.\"**  \n- **\"Adjust the ice rink temperature while avoiding equipment conflicts.\"**  \n\nWould you like any refinements or additional layers of detail?"
