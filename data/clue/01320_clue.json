Short walk from the hotel and sounded like it'd really impress on the food dimension which, after all, is what most matters, right?\n\nTop line: the food was very good but the attitude really detracted. We showed up at around 10am on Sunday. About half of the tables outside on the patio were occupied and NONE of the tables inside were; deserted. We approached the hostess as walk-ins and the attitude she radiated couldn't have been topped by most pretentiousness of Jimmy Choo saleswomen in NY or Hong Kong. It was like the scene out of \"Meet the Parents\" when the airport gate agent makes Ben Stiller wait until other passenger groups are called to board before admitting him...despite the fact noone else is visible anywhere in the terminal. That's what this hostess did to us, explaining that they had \"quite a few reservations and had to make sure they had enough tables.\" Of course, while saying this we noticed several \"Walk In\" slots on the computer terminal at her stand. She even maddeningly suggested we consider their \"other restaurant, Rioja, just across the street which usually isn't as busy.\" Are you kidding me?\n\nThus relegated to the bar, we ordered some lattes and croissants. The barman was friendly but we were so scarred by the experience with the hostess it was hard to fully appreciate him. We sensed he wasn't a big fan of the hostess either. Croissants are sourced from a local bakery; respectable as was the coffee. After half an hour at the bar and with the restaurant still mostly empty and after witnessing another walk-in ushered right to a table, we lashed back and were finally shown to a small table. There we ordered ouefs benedict and a side of bacon. All very good but not exceptional enough to make up for the hostess. Hostess aside (bad eggs everywhere I suppose), the menu is somewhat limited but, for the most part reliable. All told, disappointing. What a difference between Vendome and a place like Kitchen in Boulder, which is great in all respects.\n\n\nWe were really suprised at how difficult it was to find a good spot for dinner on a Sunday night. This seemed different in Denver than what I'm used to on the coasts, where Monday is the more typical restaurant closing day. We'd wanted to try a place like 9thDoor or Barolo Grill but all closed.\n\nTamayo was good but surprisingly lacked imagination given it's a Sandoval restaurant (or maybe because it is? I'm not as familiar with his places.). A pork shoulder dish with corn puree was tasty and prepared to order properly. The special rib eye with shrimp (Mexican restaurant, right?) was also good but like many in restaurants across the land. Can't really say anything bad about Tamayo other than it fails to really make a mark that would drive raves or name recollection a few weeks after the fact for an out of town visitor. If you're stuck for a decent meal downtown on a Sunday night, it meets the need but probably wouldn't get my nod any other day of the week.\n\n\nMuch more enjoyable than Vendome for breakfast. The eggs benedict was as good if not better and we appreciated the local egg sourcing promoted on the menu. Pancakes with cherries were delicious and I always give extra credit to breakfast places that offer real maple syrup as Snooze does. A friend ordered the huevos rancheros, which were also very good. Reading up on Snooze beforehand, I was a little uncertain because the \"fun\" aspect was emphasized very heavily. Generally speaking, places praised for fun environments or edgy decor fall short on the important thing: the food. But not true here. Snooze delivers what is probably one of Denver's best breakfasts. Oh, very good coffee from Guatemala (replete with a nice story of how the owners source it themselves) served.\n\n  1. Click to Upload a photo (10 MB limit)\n  1. Nice report. Your thoughts and observations resonate very well with my experiences so you could very well pass for a native :-) We can't both be wrong...\n\n    1. Thanks for the report! Snooty staff can really ruin a meal.\n\n      At Bistro One (new place on South Broadway) the other night our server was hyper-smiley and enthusiastic almost to the point of annoyance (\"Well played, my friends!\"), but I decided I just needed to smother my inner cynic and be smiley right back.\n\n      I'll take perky over surly any day.\n\n      2 Replies\n      1. re: Kitt\n\n        You should email them and make them aware of the lack of service. I'm sure they would like to know as there are many many other choices in Denver for breakfast and it appears they lost a potential repeat customer....the same thing happened to us at Duo. Horrible service + good food does not equal happiness.\n\n        1. re: Heyteacher\n\n          Couldn't agree more on the service opinions. Normally I'd talk to the manager on duty before leaving when something like that happens but, probably because I was only in town for a couple of days, let it slide. Turnover rates are so high in the industry in lower paying jobs, can't imagine she'll be there very long anyway.\n\n          Thanks again to everyone who posts on this board and provided such great input we relied on whilst in town.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Bistro Vendôme - A High-Stakes Restaurant Inspection & Renovation\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThe scene is set in **Bistro Vendôme**, a high-end French bistro undergoing a surprise **health & safety inspection** and last-minute **emergency kitchen repairs** before the evening dinner rush. The restaurant has just received complaints about service quality (as per the inspiration text), and the owner has called in a **multi-disciplinary team** to assess, repair, and optimize operations.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent Collaboration?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment Movement:** Industrial appliances (ovens, refrigerators) require multiple people to maneuver.  \n- **Time Pressure:** Different specialists (inspectors, chefs, technicians) must work in parallel.  \n- **Information Sharing:** Health code violations must be logged, repairs coordinated, and inventory checked.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout & Key Areas**  \nThe bistro consists of:  \n1. **Main Dining Area** – Elegant but slightly worn, with empty tables (due to recent bad reviews).  \n2. **Bar & Lounge** – Where disgruntled customers were previously seated (now empty).  \n3. **Kitchen (Primary Workspace)** – High-end but disorganized, with malfunctioning equipment.  \n4. **Storage & Prep Room** – Overstocked, poorly labeled ingredients.  \n5. **Manager’s Office** – Cluttered with paperwork, an open laptop displaying reservation logs.  \n6. **Outdoor Patio** – Partially set up, but some furniture is broken.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Area 1: Main Dining Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Six **round oak tables** (120cm diameter, draped in white linen, some with wine stains).  \n- A **heavy antique chandelier** (brass, 50kg, dangling slightly off-center).  \n- A **hostess stand** (walnut, with a cracked tablet displaying reservation slots).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Health Inspection Clipboard** (partially filled, missing a pen).  \n- **Broken Chair** (one leg splintered, needs urgent repair before service).  \n- **Customer Complaint Log** (open to a scathing review about the hostess).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Service Cart** (wobbly wheel, holds spare cutlery and napkins).  \n- **Wall-mounted Speaker** (playing faint jazz, one side crackling).  \n- **Wine Cooler** (humming, but temperature gauge flickering between 12°C and 15°C).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Framed **black-and-white Parisian photos** (one crooked, glass cracked).  \n- A **dusty faux-ivy plant** in the corner.  \n- **Discarded reservation slips** scattered near the hostess stand.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Area 2: Kitchen (High-Priority Workspace)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Gas Range** (6 burners, one leaking gas faintly).  \n- **Walk-in Refrigerator** (heavy stainless steel door, hinge squeaking).  \n- **Prep Table Island** (stainless steel, smudged with flour and grease).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Faulty Sous-Vide Machine** (display shows \"ERR 47,\" water bath cold).  \n- **Unlabeled Meat Tray** (raw beef? pork? no date sticker).  \n- **Safety Violation Sticker** (peeling off the fryer: \"LAST INSPECTION: 6 MONTHS AGO\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Chef’s Tool Rack** (missing a boning knife, one sharpening steel loose).  \n- **Digital Scale** (battery low, display flickering).  \n- **Overfilled Grease Trap** (dripping, needs urgent cleaning).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded \"Clean As You Go\" Poster** (torn at one corner).  \n- **Mismatched Aprons** (hung haphazardly, one with a ketchup stain).  \n- **Stack of Warped Cutting Boards** (some with deep knife marks).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The Walk-in Fridge Door (150kg, 2m tall)** – Requires two agents to realign the hinge.  \n- **Industrial Oven (200kg, on faulty casters)** – Needs coordinated lifting to prevent floor damage.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **unlabeled spice jars**, the correct one has:  \n  - A **red cap** (others are black/gold).  \n  - A **handwritten \"CAYENNE - HOT!\"** note (others typed).  \n  - **Half-empty** (others full or nearly empty).  \n  *(Distractor: Nearby red-capped oil bottle is decorative.)*  \n\n- **Compound Tool-Use Problem:**  \n  - **Problem:** The sous-vide machine won’t turn on.  \n  - **Solution:** The **fuse box** (in the storage room) has a tripped breaker.  \n  - **Obstacle:** The storage room is locked; the key is inside the **manager’s desk (under a coffee-stained invoice).**  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes on Scene Potential**  \nThis environment is **ripe for multi-agent problem-solving**:  \n- **Repair & Inspection Tasks** require coordination (e.g., one holds a flashlight while another fixes wiring).  \n- **Time-Sensitive Decisions** (e.g., discard spoiled food before the inspector notices).  \n- **Hidden Clues** (e.g., a crumpled note in the office reveals past health violations).  \n\nEvery object has **weight, state, and purpose**, ensuring agents must **collaborate, reason, and adapt** to succeed.  \n\n---  \nWould you like any refinements or additional layers of complexity?"
