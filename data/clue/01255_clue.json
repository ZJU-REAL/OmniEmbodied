  "response": "# **Three-Stage Active Filter Testing Laboratory**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\nA *high-frequency electronics testing laboratory* dedicated to prototyping and validating multi-stage active filter circuits. The lab is designed for collaborative troubleshooting, where engineers must verify theoretical calculations against real-world measurements. The environment inherently requires multi-agent collaboration due to:  \n- **Heavy equipment** needing multiple people to move or adjust.  \n- **Distributed tools and components** requiring coordinated retrieval.  \n- **Complex testing procedures** where one engineer measures while another adjusts circuit parameters.  \n\nThe lab has a **lived-in, slightly chaotic** atmosphere—half-finished projects, scribbled whiteboard equations, and scattered calibration tools.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\nThe lab is divided into **four interconnected zones**:  \n\n1. **Main Workbench Area** – Central hub with oscilloscopes, signal generators, and breadboards.  \n2. **Component Storage Wall** – Shelves with labeled bins of resistors, capacitors, and ICs.  \n3. **Measurement & Calibration Station** – Dedicated space for precise signal analysis.  \n4. **Documentation & Planning Corner** – Whiteboards, reference manuals, and a cluttered desk.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Workbench Area**  \n*(Primary workspace for assembling and testing the three-stage filter circuit.)*  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Heavy-duty steel workbench** (2.5m × 1.2m, bolted to the floor, with built-in ESD mat).  \n- **Oscilloscope station** (Tektronix MDO3000, screen displaying a frozen sine wave).  \n- **Signal generator rack** (Keysight 33600A, currently set to 1kHz sine output).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Prototype breadboard** (populated with resistors, capacitors, and three op-amps—one stage visibly misaligned).  \n- **Multimeter** (Fluke 87V, set to AC voltage mode, leads tangled).  \n- **Calibration screwdriver set** (fine-adjustment tools for potentiometers).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Soldering station** (Weller WES51, iron cold but with a half-melted solder blob).  \n- **Power supply unit** (dual-output, one channel flickering).  \n- **Component trays** (small plastic bins with loose resistors).  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Coffee-stained circuit schematics** (taped to the bench edge, corners curling).  \n- **Faded \"HIGH VOLTAGE\" warning sticker** (peeling off the oscilloscope).  \n- **Dusty oscilloscope probes** (hanging from a hook, one with a broken tip).  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Component Storage Wall**  \n*(Organized but slightly disheveled storage for electronic parts.)*  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Modular shelving unit** (aluminum frame, 2m tall, with labeled plastic bins).  \n- **ESD-safe storage cabinet** (locked, containing sensitive ICs).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Bin of 1% tolerance resistors** (labeled, but some mixed into adjacent bins).  \n- **Sealed capacitor reel** (100nF, with a \"LAST ONE\" sticky note).  \n- **Op-amp IC tray** (TL072, LM741, and OPA2134—one missing).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Component tester** (Peak Atlas LCR, battery low).  \n- **Label maker** (Brother PT-D210, out of tape).  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Old electronics magazines** (stacked haphazardly, some with dog-eared pages).  \n- **Handwritten inventory list** (taped to the cabinet, some entries crossed out).  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Measurement & Calibration Station**  \n*(Precision area for signal analysis.)*  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Spectrum analyzer** (Rigol DSA815, warmed up but idle).  \n- **Vibration-isolated table** (for sensitive measurements).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **BNC cables** (one with a loose connector).  \n- **Frequency counter** (displaying a drifting value).  \n- **Calibration certificate** (expired, pinned to the wall).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Desk lamp** (LED, flickering slightly).  \n- **Anti-static wrist strap** (dangling from a hook).  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Sticky note with \"CALIBRATE ME\"** (on the analyzer).  \n- **Outdated calibration chart** (from 2018).  \n\n---  \n\n### **D. Documentation & Planning Corner**  \n*(Messy but critical for collaborative problem-solving.)*  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Whiteboard** (covered in filter equations and crossed-out attempts).  \n- **Overstuffed filing cabinet** (drawer slightly ajar).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Printed datasheets** (highlighted, some with coffee rings).  \n- **Reference textbook** (*The Art of Electronics*, bookmarked on filter design).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Desktop PC** (running Multisim, frozen on a simulation).  \n- **Printer** (out of paper, error light blinking).  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Framed \"Employee of the Month\" certificate** (dusty, from 2020).  \n- **Half-dead potted plant** (leaves browning).  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Signal generator rack** (weight: 85kg, requires two people to reposition).  \n- **ESD-safe cabinet** (locked, key stored in a different room, requiring retrieval).  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning**:  \n  - Among **five capacitor reels**, only one has a **handwritten \"100nF ±2%\" label**, while others are factory-sealed. A **decorative blue glass jar** nearby adds visual noise.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning**:  \n  - **Problem**: The oscilloscope shows noise—likely a **loose BNC connector**.  \n  - **Solution**: The **calibration screwdriver set** (on the workbench) can tighten it, but the **correct size is missing**, requiring a search in the storage wall.  \n\n### **Dynamic State Problems**  \n- **Flickering power supply** (needs adjustment).  \n- **Misaligned op-amp** (requires resoldering).  \n- **Expired calibration certificate** (must be updated before final testing).  \n\n---  \n\nThis **dense, interactive lab environment** is primed for complex multi-agent tasks—requiring coordination, precise reasoning, and tool-based problem-solving."
