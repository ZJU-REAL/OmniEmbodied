Try clicking \"votes\" then try to follow the link again. –  Perpetual Motion Goat Feb 5 '10 at 14:20\nAh - my default view is newest first. In that case I withdraw my comment. –  ChrisF Feb 5 '10 at 14:22\ni see the issue you're talking about. by the fact that there's no other obvious permalink offered in the UI, i have to assume this is a valid bug. –  quack quixote Feb 5 '10 at 14:26\nPermalinks for answers on the first page are broken too, and get one one page too far. In fact: this happens for any last answer on any page, when sorted on oldest. See meta.stackexchange.com/questions/38103/…, which I guess is a duplicate (assuming the blank page only shows if there's no answers yet on the one-page-too-far page?) –  Arjan Feb 5 '10 at 14:50\nI don't know if that is the same issue, but I'm pretty sure that a URL that is meant to be a permalink should not be affected by the cookies of whoever happens to follow it. –  Perpetual Motion Goat Feb 5 '10 at 15:16\n@Arjan I think this is more closely related to meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18815/… (even though it's tagged \"feature-request' not \"bug\") –  Perpetual Motion Goat Feb 5 '10 at 15:35\nThe link works for me. It takes me to the answer, which is on page three of the answers when sorted by votes. edit: Oops, now I see a problem. This link to the last answer (when sorted by votes) doesn't work for me: stackoverflow.com/questions/731832/interview-question-ffn-n/… It just takes me to the question. –  raven Feb 5 '10 at 18:04\nThrow some ideas on this: meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18815/… –  random Feb 6 '10 at 9:04\nI added a screen capture at meta.stackexchange.com/questions/38103/… -- which I guess is what you saw too? That's NOT a blank page then? –  Arjan Feb 9 '10 at 11:10\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\n\n\n\nshare|improve this answer\nLook like this issue - meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18815/… - might be fixed too. –  ChrisF Feb 9 '10 at 12:51\nI don't know whether to down-vote for making the mistake, or up-vote for finally fixing it. –  Brad Gilbert Feb 9 '10 at 14:22\n\nThe permalinks implicitly require that you have not changed the default sort order from Votes.\n\nThis is [status-bydesign] at the moment.\n\nedit: assuming you have the default votes sort order, my guess is that this is sometimes affected by deleted posts; do you guys have the 10k rep to see the deleted posts in these questions?\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI clicked on the \"comments\" link on one of the OSS ads today and was directed to the wrong page of answers. Why might that happen? (And yes, I have the default sort order.) –  mmyers Feb 5 '10 at 22:08\nHow long is this 'moment' going to last? –  Jonathan Leffler Feb 5 '10 at 22:19\nI was sorting by votes, as stated in the question. Unfortunately you can't see the problem with the answer I linked anymore as it has been upvoted from -1 to 0. –  Perpetual Motion Goat Feb 6 '10 at 6:48\n@Jeff, Possibly. My rep is 5K, but mmeyers has 23K. –  Perpetual Motion Goat Feb 6 '10 at 9:15\n@Jeff, how about rendering the question page(s) to figure out where the linked question should be? If someone has clicked the link you're going to have to render it anyway. Would it be a disaster if you occasionally rendered the wrong page first and had to discard the result? –  Perpetual Motion Goat Feb 6 '10 at 9:19\n@perpetual mmeyers does not have 10k rep on meta, which is what he was referring to. –  Jeff Atwood Feb 6 '10 at 9:30\n\nYou must log in to answer this question.\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"The Digital Archive Recovery Center\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-tech, slightly chaotic digital archive recovery center where teams of technicians and AI assistants work to salvage, organize, and restore lost or corrupted data from obsolete storage media. The environment is a hybrid of retro and cutting-edge tech, with stacks of old hard drives, tape reels, and optical discs alongside modern forensic workstations. The nature of the work—handling fragile physical media while coordinating digital recovery—makes this an inherently multi-agent environment.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility is divided into four main zones:  \n\n1. **Intake & Sorting Bay** – A cluttered receiving area where incoming media is logged, inspected, and prepped for recovery.  \n2. **Forensic Workstations** – A row of high-powered computers with specialized data recovery tools, surrounded by diagnostic equipment.  \n3. **Cold Storage Vault** – A climate-controlled room for sensitive or degraded media, requiring careful handling.  \n4. **Repair & Salvage Bench** – A workbench with tools for physical repairs on damaged drives and tapes.  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Intake & Sorting Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A large steel sorting table (2.5m x 1.2m) with anti-static mats and labeled bins (\"Pending,\" \"Contaminated,\" \"Priority\").  \n- A heavy-duty cart (120cm tall, with locking wheels) for transporting fragile media.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A stack of 5.25-inch floppy disks (some warped, some with mold growth).  \n- A locked case labeled \"Degraded Media: Handle Under Nitrogen Only.\"  \n- A barcode scanner with a sticky note reading \"Calibration off—adjust manually.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A label printer (low on ink, jam indicator blinking).  \n- A digital scale (reads in grams and ounces, slightly off-center).  \n- A bin of anti-static gloves (some torn, some unused).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A faded \"Data Handling Procedures\" poster peeling off the wall.  \n- A coffee-stained logbook with handwritten entries.  \n- A small potted cactus (barely alive, covered in dust).  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Forensic Workstations**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Three ergonomic workstations with adjustable monitor arms and RAID-equipped forensic PCs.  \n- A server rack (2m tall, wheels locked) humming with backup storage.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A USB floppy emulator set to \"read-only mode.\"  \n- A corrupted external HDD with a red \"DO NOT POWER ON\" tag.  \n- A forensic write-blocker with a loose connection.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A multi-port USB hub (half the ports nonfunctional).  \n- A secondary monitor displaying a scrolling hex dump.  \n- A sticky note pad with scribbled error codes.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A novelty \"I ❤️ Data\" mug full of pens.  \n- A framed photo of a 1990s-era computer lab.  \n- A dead pixel on the leftmost monitor.  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Cold Storage Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A sealed environmental chamber (1.8m x 1.8m) with a digital hygrometer.  \n- A reinforced storage cabinet (locked, requires two keys).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A vacuum-sealed bag of magnetic tapes marked \"NASA Backup - 1986.\"  \n- A nitrogen canister (pressure gauge in the yellow zone).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A dehumidifier (filter light blinking).  \n- A pair of insulated gloves (left glove missing).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A yellowed \"Biohazard\" sticker (misplaced, from an old lab).  \n- A scratched-up CD labeled \"MUSIC MIX - DO NOT ERASE.\"  \n\n---  \n\n### **D. Repair & Salvage Bench**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A sturdy ESD-safe workbench with magnifying lamp.  \n- A microscope with a cracked slide tray.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A disassembled hard drive (platter scratched, heads misaligned).  \n- A precision screwdriver set (missing the T5 bit).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A soldering iron (temperature dial sticky).  \n- A can of compressed air (nearly empty).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A wall calendar stuck on June 1999.  \n- A dusty \"Best Technician 2003\" plaque.  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- The **\"Degraded Media\" case** (weight: 25kg, requires nitrogen handling) must be moved by two agents to prevent exposure to air.  \n- The **server rack** (150kg, 2m tall) cannot be repositioned without coordinated effort.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among five identical-looking hard drives, only one has a **scratched label**, a **green warranty void sticker**, and **unusual vibration when spun**—key clues for identifying the faulty unit.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The locked storage cabinet requires two keys (one held by the lab manager, one misplaced in the intake bay).  \n  - **Solution:** Agents must first find the lost key (hidden under a stack of floppies) and then retrieve the second key from a distracted manager.  \n\nThis environment is **dense with potential tasks**, requiring agents to navigate physical constraints, troubleshoot technical failures, and collaborate under pressure—just like real-world data recovery operations."
