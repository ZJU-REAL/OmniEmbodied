Let $Y_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ and let us note $F_n$ (resp. $\\Phi$) the cumulative distribution function of $\\frac{Y_n \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}$ (resp. of the standard normal distribution). Then, Berry Esseen theorem states that there exists a positive constant $C$ such that for all $x$ and $n$, $$|F_n(x)-\\Phi(x)| \\leq \\frac{C \\rho}{\\sigma^3 \\sqrt{n}}.$$\n\nAre there known conditions on the distribution of $X_1$ that allow to derive a similar statement for probability density functions instead of cumulative distribution functions?\n\nshare|improve this question\nSure. Look, e.g., at the supplements to chapter VII in the classical book \"Sums of independent random variables\" by Petrov. –  Yvan Velenik Sep 19 '11 at 9:02\nok, thanks! I just need to find a copy of the book... –  Anthony Leverrier Sep 19 '11 at 9:16\nHum. If you search for \"Sums of independent random variables\" Petrov on google.com, you should find what you need on the first page of results ;) ... –  Yvan Velenik Sep 19 '11 at 9:24\nindeed! Thanks. –  Anthony Leverrier Sep 19 '11 at 9:27\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 5 down vote accepted\n\nThe magic words are \"local limit theorem\".\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Probability Archive\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA dimly lit, labyrinthine mathematics research archive tucked away in the basement of an old university. The space is a chaotic blend of academic rigor and haphazard organization—stacks of yellowing manuscripts, chalkboards dense with half-erased equations, and experimental probability machines humming in the background. The core challenge of the environment is **collaborative retrieval and verification of rare statistical proofs**, requiring agents to navigate cluttered workspaces, decipher handwritten notes, and operate delicate analog computing devices.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Physical Constraints:** Some objects (large chalkboards, heavy reference books, bulky mechanical calculators) require coordinated movement.  \n- **Information Scattering:** Critical data is fragmented across multiple documents, demanding simultaneous cross-referencing.  \n- **Machine Operation:** Certain devices need one agent to input data while another adjusts calibration.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe archive is divided into four interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **The Foyer (Entry & Sorting Hub)**  \n   - A cramped vestibule with overflowing mail slots, a creaky wooden desk, and a flickering overhead bulb.  \n   - A rusted rolling cart half-blocking the doorway, laden with unsorted manuscripts.  \n\n2. **The Proof Vault (Core Reference Section)**  \n   - Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves sagging under leather-bound tomes.  \n   - A heavy oak table dominates the center, its surface scarred from decades of pencil marks.  \n\n3. **The Calculation Engine Room**  \n   - A humming, overheated space housing three **Brunsviga mechanical calculators**, an **antique curve-plotting apparatus**, and a **wall-sized abacus**.  \n   - Exposed wiring snakes along the floor; one calculator emits a faint burning smell.  \n\n4. **The Scholar’s Nook (Informal Workspace)**  \n   - A sunken seating area with mismatched armchairs, a coffee-stained Persian rug, and a perpetually boiling kettle.  \n   - A chalkboard covered in scribbled conjectures, partially obscured by a tattered curtain.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Area 1: The Foyer**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- A **vintage sorting desk (180cm x 80cm)**, its surface warped from spilled ink. Left drawer jammed shut.  \n- A **steel mail cart (120kg, 1.5m tall)**, one wheel squeaking irregularly.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **\"Petrov’s Sums of Independent Random Variables\" (1st ed.)** – Wedged under a stack of unopened envelopes, spine cracked at Chapter VII.  \n- **A wax-sealed envelope** labeled *\"Local Limit Theorem – DO NOT DISCARD\"* in red ink.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- A **rotary phone** off the hook, emitting a dial tone.  \n- A **wall-mounted key rack** holding 12 brass keys, one tagged *\"Engine Room – Backup\"*.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- Faded **\"Silence! Proofs in Progress\"** poster peeling off the wall.  \n- A **dead potted fern** on the windowsill, soil littered with paperclips.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Area 2: The Proof Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Bookshelf Gamma (2.4m tall, 300kg)** – Requires two agents to tilt for access to a hidden panel behind it.  \n- **Central Table (200kg, 3m long)** – One leg shorter, causing a visible tilt.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **\"Berry-Esseen Original Manuscript\"** – In a locked glass case (key in Foyer desk).  \n- **A chalk-dusted slide rule** with a hairline crack, stored in a velvet-lined box.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- A **magnifying glass** dangling from a nail.  \n- A **leather-bound ledger** open to a page titled *\"Unverified Corollaries.\"*  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- A **dusty framed portrait** of a frowning mathematician.  \n- A **broken metronome** stuck at 60 BPM.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Area 3: The Calculation Engine Room**  \n*(Example of collaborative affordance: The Brunsviga calculator requires one agent to turn the crank while another aligns the decimal slider.)*  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Brunsviga Model III (80kg)** – Leftmost unit emits a faint ozone smell; display stuck on \"0.333…\".  \n- **Wall Abacus (4m wide)** – Missing three beads in the lower-right quadrant.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **A punch card labeled *\"σ³/ρ Convergence Test\"*** – Jammed in a reader slot.  \n- **A vial of *\"Machine Oil – For Precision Use Only\"*** – Half-empty, stored atop a volatile steam pipe.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **4. Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n- **Collaborative Transport:** The **Bookshelf Gamma (300kg)** must be tilted by two agents to access a hidden compartment.  \n- **Reasoning Challenge:** Identifying the correct **\"Local Limit Theorem\"** envelope among near-identical decoys requires checking:  \n  - Wax seal color (only one is **blood-red**).  \n  - Postmark date (**May 11, 1962**, matching Petrov’s publication).  \n- **Compound Tool Use:** To fix the stuck Brunsviga:  \n  1. Retrieve the **\"Engine Room – Backup\" key** from the Foyer.  \n  2. Use it to open a maintenance panel revealing a **jammed gear**.  \n  3. Apply **machine oil** from the vial (if overused, it spills and corrodes the floor).  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Atmosphere:** A place where numbers breathe—where the scent of old paper mixes with machine oil, where every object holds latent meaning, and where collaboration is the only way to untangle the threads of probability."
