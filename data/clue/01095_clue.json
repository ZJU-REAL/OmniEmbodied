  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *RV Repair & Inspection Workshop*  \n**Core Concept:** A bustling, semi-organized RV repair garage specializing in recalling and servicing defective Dometic refrigerators. The scene is inherently collaborative due to the physical demands of handling large RV components, the technical complexity of diagnostics, and the urgency of preventing potential fire hazards.  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe workshop is divided into four key areas:  \n1. **Main Service Bay** – A high-ceilinged garage space with hydraulic lifts, tool chests, and diagnostic equipment. The primary workspace for fridge removal and repairs.  \n2. **Parts & Inventory Storage** – Shelving units packed with replacement components, gaskets, coolant, and tools. Contains a locked cabinet for hazardous materials.  \n3. **Customer Check-In & Documentation Zone** – A cluttered desk with a computer, stacks of recall notices, and a bulletin board with service schedules.  \n4. **RV Holding Area** – An outdoor lot where RVs await service, some with open access panels or partially removed fridges.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Service Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A 3-ton hydraulic lift with grease stains and a slight hydraulic fluid leak near its base.  \n- A rolling tool chest (1.2m tall, 6 drawers, one slightly jammed) with a magnetic strip holding frequently used wrenches.  \n- A ceiling-mounted pulley system (max load: 250kg) for hoisting heavy fridge units.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Defective Dometic Fridge (Model RM2354)** – Disconnected from power, with scorch marks near the rear electrical panel. Requires two people to lift (85kg, 1.8m tall).  \n- **Diagnostic Multimeter** – Left on the floor, set to \"voltage test,\" with frayed probe wires.  \n- **Replacement Wiring Harness** – Sealed in a labeled anti-static bag (PN: DH-7721) atop a parts cart.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A rolling coolant tank (half-full, pressure gauge at 30 PSI).  \n- A wall-mounted fire extinguisher (last inspected 3 months ago).  \n- A dented mini-fridge (functional) stocked with energy drinks.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Faded \"Safety First\" poster with a peeling corner.  \n- A coffee mug (\"World’s Best RV Tech\") filled with pens and a snapped screwdriver.  \n- A grease-stained calendar showing last month’s date.  \n\n#### **2. Parts & Inventory Storage**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Heavy-duty steel shelving (2.4m tall, four shelves, slightly bowed under weight).  \n- A locked chemical cabinet (requires keycard) labeled \"FLAMMABLE – AUTHORIZED ONLY.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Replacement Fridge Gaskets** – Three boxes (red, blue, yellow labels indicating size variants), one box partially open with a gasket dangling out.  \n- **Hazardous Coolant Canisters** – Stacked in a secondary containment tray, one leaking a drop every few minutes (audible *plink*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A label printer out of tape, blinking an \"ERROR\" light.  \n- A barcode scanner dangling from a hook, battery compartment taped shut.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A dusty \"Employee of the Month\" plaque from 2018.  \n- A stack of outdated RV magazines with curled pages.  \n\n#### **3. Customer Check-In & Documentation Zone**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A cluttered L-shaped desk with a sticky keyboard and a flickering monitor.  \n- A wall-mounted whiteboard with a half-erased list of VINs needing recall service.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Recall Database Terminal** – Slow, running Windows XP, with a sticky note reading \"PASSWORD: fridge123.\"  \n- **Keycard for Chemical Cabinet** – Slid under a coffee stain on the desk.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A jammed paper shredder with a protruding recall document.  \n- A landline phone with a sticky note: \"Call Dometic rep re: Batch #4421.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A novelty \"Keep Calm and Repair On\" sign hanging crookedly.  \n- A dead potted cactus next to an empty water bottle.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Defective Fridge (85kg, 1.8m tall)** – Requires two agents to maneuver safely onto the hydraulic lift. The ceiling pulley could assist but needs one agent to operate the controls while another guides the load.  \n- **Coolant Tank (Full weight: 120kg)** – Mobile but unstable when full; tipping risk necessitates one agent to stabilize while another wheels it.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five coolant canisters, the leaking one is uniquely identifiable by:  \n  - A handwritten \"**Batch #4421 – TEST PENDING**\" label.  \n  - A small dent on its side (vs. pristine others).  \n  - Background \"noise\": A decorative but non-functional blue funnel nearby could distract from the real issue.  \n- **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The chemical cabinet is locked.  \n  - **Solution:** The keycard is hidden under a coffee stain on the desk, but the agent must first:  \n    - Notice the \"AUTHORIZED ONLY\" sign.  \n    - Cross-reference the recall terminal’s notes mentioning \"flammable coolant access.\"  \n    - Filter through desk clutter to locate the card.  \n\nThis scene thrives on **physical collaboration**, **diagnostic reasoning**, and **environmental awareness**, with every object serving either as a puzzle piece, a distractor, or an atmospheric enhancer."
