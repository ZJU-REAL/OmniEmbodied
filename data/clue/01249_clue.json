Horner 34 S 02 - 1210 - DR - 00582\n\nAndrea Lynn Ciobanu\n\nCase Conclusion Date:October 1, 2012\n\nPractice Area:Appeals\n\nOutcome:Published Indiana Supreme Court Opinion.\n\nDescription:On behalf of the ADR Section and the Indiana Association of Mediators, we have argued that mediations are confidential and fall within an evidentiary exception of ADR Rule 2.11. We argued before the Indiana Supreme Court and the Indiana Supreme Court agreed with our position. Further, we requested that a task force review the ADR rules and determine what changes, if any, need to be made to the ADR rules, after no changes were made for approximately 20 years. As a result, a task force was created and has reviewed the rules and made the recommendations for various modifications and updates to the ADR rules. Please note that all dispositions of cases depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Indiana Supreme Court Archives & Mediation Task Force Office\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA hybrid environment merging the stately grandeur of the **Indiana Supreme Court’s archival wing** with the bustling, document-heavy workspace of a **mediation task force office**. The scene revolves around legal research, evidence retrieval, and collaborative document review—requiring agents to navigate physical archives, cross-reference confidential materials, and prepare recommendations for ADR rule updates.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy lifting:** Legal tomes, sealed evidence boxes, and bulky filing cabinets require multiple agents.  \n- **Dual workspaces:** Simultaneous coordination between the archives (historical records) and the task force office (active deliberations).  \n- **Secure access:** Some documents are restricted (keycard-protected drawers, locked binders), demanding role-based cooperation.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe scene comprises **three interconnected zones**:  \n\n1. **Supreme Court Archives (Restricted Section)**  \n   - High-ceilinged, dimly lit, with towering oak bookshelves.  \n   - Rolling ladders, a locked glass evidence display (containing sealed case artifacts), and a digital archive terminal.  \n   - **Purpose:** Retrieve case precedents, verify confidential mediation records.  \n\n2. **Mediation Task Force Office**  \n   - Open-plan workspace with cluttered desks, whiteboards covered in rule-change proposals, and a conference table stacked with binders.  \n   - **Purpose:** Draft recommendations, cross-examine procedural inconsistencies.  \n\n3. **Secure Document Prep Room**  \n   - Soundproofed, with a large scanner, shredder, and wall-safe for confidential materials.  \n   - **Purpose:** Digitize sensitive files, redact privileged information.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Zone 1: Supreme Court Archives**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Floor-to-ceiling oak bookshelves** (3.5m tall, labeled \"ADR Cases: 1990–2012\").  \n- **Antique wooden ladder** (wheels squeak, one rung slightly loose).  \n- **Evidence display case** (1.2m tall, glass, electronic lock keypad, interior UV-light to prevent tampering).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed evidence box** (30x40x15cm, marked *\"Horner v. Horner – CONFIDENTIAL\"*, requires two keys held by different agents).  \n- **Digital archive terminal** (slow boot-up, requires a physical dongle plugged into the side).  \n- **Leather-bound ADR Rules binder** (1989 edition, outdated, hidden behind a false panel in Shelf 4B).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Microfilm reader** (dusty, but functional; drawer contains three reels labeled \"Mediation Transcripts – 2004\").  \n- **Wheeled cart** (holds red \"RESTRICTED\" folders; one wheel sticks).  \n- **Fireproof safe** (under desk, combination lock, contains backup hard drives).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Portrait of Justice Robert D. Rucker** (slightly crooked, frame chipped).  \n- **Dead fern** (in cracked ceramic pot atop a filing cabinet).  \n- **Out-of-order sign** (taped to a flickering overhead light).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Zone 2: Mediation Task Force Office**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Conference table** (scratched mahogany, sticky note-covered, center has a dent from a dropped laptop).  \n- **Whiteboard** (half-erased, reads *\"ADR Rule 2.11 – Scope of Confidentiality??\"*).  \n- **Overflowing printer** (paper jam light blinking).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Draft proposal binder** (tabbed sections, missing pages 34–37).  \n- **Task force member keycards** (three distinct colors: red for senior staff, blue for interns, yellow for IT).  \n- **Evidence comparison lightbox** (for verifying document authenticity).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Coffee maker** (burnt smell, \"OUT OF ORDER\" sticky note).  \n- **Document scanner** (error message: \"CALIBRATION NEEDED\").  \n- **Stapler** (jammed with a bent staple).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed newspaper clipping** (*\"Indiana Supreme Court Upholds Mediation Privacy – 2012\"*).  \n- **Half-eaten donut** (on a napkin next to a sticky keyboard).  \n- **Dusty gavel** (displayed on a shelf, a joke gift labeled *\"For Emergency Deadlocks\"*).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Zone 3: Secure Document Prep Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial shredder** (overheating warning light, bin 80% full).  \n- **Wall-mounted safe** (biometric scanner, but backup keyhole hidden behind a painting).  \n- **Large format scanner** (covered in \"DO NOT TOUCH – CALIBRATING\" signs).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Redaction station** (black markers, UV light for detecting hidden text).  \n- **Sealed evidence bags** (requires two keycards to open).  \n- **Confidential waste bin** (locked, full of shredded paper).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label maker** (out of tape).  \n- **Document trolley** (wobbly wheel).  \n- **Gloves & magnifying glass** (for handling delicate originals).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"CONFIDENTIAL – UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS PROHIBITED\"** sign (peeling at the corners).  \n- **Fake plant** (covered in dust).  \n- **Broken clock** (stuck at 4:23).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Sealed evidence crate (50kg, 1.5m long)** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Overflowing file cart (wheels jammed)** – One agent must stabilize while another pulls.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five ADR binders**, the correct one is identifiable by:  \n    - **Unique spine label** (*\"1992 Amendments – Annotated\"*)  \n    - **Coffee stain** on page 43 (matches a note in the task force office).  \n    - **Background noise:** A decorative blue binder nearby nearly matches—forcing precision.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **evidence display case** is locked.  \n  - **Solution:** The **electronic keypad code** is written in a **senior staffer’s notebook** (in the office), but the notebook itself is inside a **locked drawer** (needs a blue keycard).  \n\n#### **Dynamic State Affordances:**  \n- **Printer jam** (requires removing a crumpled page).  \n- **Shredder bin full** (must be emptied before further use).  \n- **Flickering light** (could distract during UV evidence checks).  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** Every object serves a purpose—whether as a critical task piece, a collaborative obstacle, or atmospheric texture. The density ensures agents must *navigate*, *reason*, and *cooperate* at every turn."
