  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Abandoned Biomedical Research Station**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nAn abandoned biomedical research station, hidden deep within a dense forest, was once a hub for cutting-edge genetic experiments. The facility was evacuated in haste, leaving behind equipment, samples, and scattered research notes. The air hums with the faint buzz of failing electronics, and the scent of antiseptic lingers beneath the musk of damp concrete.  \n\nThis environment is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy or fragile objects** requiring coordinated transport.  \n- **Security systems** needing simultaneous actions (e.g., accessing terminals in different rooms).  \n- **Time-sensitive tasks**, such as stabilizing failing cryogenic storage or deactivating a generator before it overheats.  \n\nThe scene is ripe for investigation, sabotage, or salvage operations—forcing agents to navigate hazards, interpret cryptic records, and manipulate delicate machinery.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility consists of three main interconnected zones:  \n\n### **A. Main Laboratory**  \n- **Purpose:** Primary research space with biosafety containment units and analytical equipment.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Sterile but decaying—flickering overhead fluorescents, cracked observation windows, and a persistent ozone smell from malfunctioning electronics.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - A central **emergency lockdown panel** (partially smashed, wires exposed).  \n  - **Biohazard containment pods** (some shattered, others still sealed with fogged glass).  \n  - A **large industrial centrifuge** (leaking coolant, making the floor slick).  \n\n### **B. Storage & Maintenance Annex**  \n- **Purpose:** Houses backup generators, spare parts, and archived research.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic, dimly lit by emergency lighting. The scent of oil and mildew mixes with the faint metallic tang of old blood samples.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - A **leaking nitrogen tank** (hissing faintly, creating a hazardous cold zone).  \n  - **Metal supply crates** (some pried open, others still sealed with tamper-proof locks).  \n  - A **locked server rack** (blinking erratically, containing corrupted experiment logs).  \n\n### **C. Observation Deck & Offices**  \n- **Purpose:** Monitoring station with workstations and personal effects of former researchers.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Papers strewn everywhere, coffee stains on keyboards, a single **shattered photograph** of a team pinned under a magnet.  \n- **Key Features:**  \n  - A **manual override terminal** (requires two separate keycards to activate).  \n  - A **broken surveillance monitor** (showing static with brief flickers of past footage).  \n  - A **wall-mounted first aid kit** (emptied except for a single roll of gauze).  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Laboratory**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Biosafety Level-3 Containment Pods (3 units)**  \n  - One **shattered**, glass shards scattered, dried fluid residue on the floor.  \n  - One **intact but fogged**, interior obscured by condensation.  \n  - One **sealed with a blinking red \"QUARANTINE LOCK\" indicator**.  \n- **Industrial Centrifuge (Model: Vortex-9000)**  \n  - **Leaking coolant**, forming a slowly expanding puddle near the drain.  \n  - **Control panel smashed**, but the emergency stop is still functional (requires two people to press simultaneously).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Shattered Cryo-Tube**  \n  - **Broken glass**, a **frozen cadaver** partially thawed, left hand missing.  \n  - **Serial number etched into the base: \"XG-7742\"**, matching a **scorched file folder** in the office.  \n- **Emergency Power Switch**  \n  - **Cover missing**, wires exposed.  \n  - **Requires a screwdriver (located in maintenance) and insulated gloves (hanging on a nearby hook)** to safely toggle.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Microscope (Model: Zeiss Axiotech 100)**  \n  - **Dust-covered**, but functional.  \n  - **Slide still loaded**—stained with an unknown substance.  \n- **Chemical Spill Kit**  \n  - **Seal broken**, contents half-used.  \n  - **Missing neutralizing agent**, implying a prior accident.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **\"PROTOCOL DELTA\" Warning Poster**  \n  - Faded, partially torn, but legible: **\"DO NOT OPEN CONTAINMENT WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.\"**  \n- **Coffee Mug with Mold**  \n  - **\"World’s Best Geneticist\"** printed on the side.  \n  - **Fungal growth** inside, suggesting long abandonment.  \n- **Dented Metal Clipboard**  \n  - **Half-burned notes** on \"Subject XG-7742: Unstable Regeneration.\"  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Storage & Maintenance Annex**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Backup Generator (Model: Titan-40kW)**  \n  - **Overheating**, emitting a high-pitched whine.  \n  - **Fuel gauge at 8%**, timer counting down to automatic shutdown.  \n- **Server Rack (Locked, Model: SecureNet-6U)**  \n  - **Blinking amber \"CORRUPTED DATA\" light.**  \n  - **Requires two admin keycards (one in the office, one in the lab).**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Sealed Hazardous Waste Drum**  \n  - **Label: \"Biohazard Level 4 – Do Not Open Without Suit.\"**  \n  - **Rusted lock**—can be forced open with **bolt cutters (hanging on the wall).**  \n- **Maintenance Toolbox**  \n  - **Missing the Phillips screwdriver (last used in the lab).**  \n  - **Lockpick set tucked under a rag.**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Hydraulic Lift Cart**  \n  - **Functional but requires two people to operate.**  \n  - **Used to move heavy crates (some marked \"FRAGILE: LIVE CULTURES\").**  \n- **Wall-Mounted Fire Extinguisher**  \n  - **Expired two years ago.**  \n  - **Gauge shows empty.**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Employee Punch-In Clock**  \n  - **Stuck at 03:47 AM—the time of evacuation.**  \n- **Graffiti on the Wall**  \n  - **\"They lied to us.\"** scrawled in black marker.  \n- **Dusty Hard Hat**  \n  - **Cracked visor, name tag: \"J. Reyes.\"**  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Observation Deck & Offices**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Manual Override Terminal**  \n  - **Two keycard slots, one labeled \"SECURITY,\" the other \"RESEARCH.\"**  \n  - **Display reads: \"SYSTEM FAILURE – MANUAL REBOOT REQUIRED.\"**  \n- **Surveillance Monitor Bank**  \n  - **Most screens dead; one flickers, showing a **static-filled hallway feed.**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Security Keycard (Dr. L. Chen)**  \n  - **Wedged under a keyboard.**  \n  - **Magnetic strip slightly damaged—might fail after one use.**  \n- **Encrypted Laptop**  \n  - **Password hint: \"Subject XG-7742’s first symptom date.\" (Found in the lab notes.)**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Landline Phone**  \n  - **Off the hook, emitting a dead dial tone.**  \n- **Whiteboard**  \n  - **Half-erased formulas, a crude **\"DON’T TRUST THEM\"** scribbled in the corner.**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Family Photo (Shattered)**  \n  - **Shows a research team; one face scratched out violently.**  \n- **\"Employee of the Month\" Certificate**  \n  - **Name burned away by an acid spill.**  \n- **Half-Eaten Candy Bar**  \n  - **Petrified, still in its wrapper.**  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Overheating Generator (150kg, requires two agents to stabilize before shutdown).**  \n- **Hazardous Waste Drum (sealed, 80kg—needs a cart and two agents to move safely).**  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Five **chemical bottles** on the lab shelf:  \n    - **All have blue caps except one (red-capped, labeled \"NEUROTOXIN – DO NOT MIX\").**  \n    - **Distraction:** A **blue decorative flask** sits nearby, empty but visually similar.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The locked server rack contains critical data.  \n  - **Solution:** Requires **two keycards (one in the office, one in the lab).**  \n "
