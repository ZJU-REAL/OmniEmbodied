Especially if you ignore the part where they nerfed her as well.\n#23PKMNsonyPosted 11/9/2012 10:26:05 PM\ni won my muny bak den rito!\n#24VoidgolemPosted 11/9/2012 10:49:46 PM\nProvided I can actually carry from the jungle now, I'd be 100% ok with whatever else they did with the game.\n\n200% if supposed Mastermune turns out to be real.\n#25NuramaTheBDPosted 11/9/2012 10:52:58 PM\nLittle Zardar posted...\nwho cares? this game has been practically the same for a year now. the only new \"content\" are champs which have 4 buttons. the jungle is the same, the lanes are the same, the damn meta is the same. you also build the same s*** each game practically. it's boring.\n\ni seriously wonder how you guys play this every single day for months/years. ive played all the champs now and i get bored to tears just playing a couple of games every now and then. the only thing that interests me anymore are new champions which are fun for 2 or 3 hours.\n\nwatching the game being competitively played is a borefest as well. the same damn 50 champs each time. a game with 150+ champs yet you only see 1/3 on them in pro games, what's up with that anyway?\n\nbring on the damn change, and i hope it's a lot of changes.\n\nBarely over 100 is 150+ legit. >.>\n#26FlareZeroPosted 11/9/2012 10:58:56 PM\nRiot has to face reality that altering the gameplay and meta won't make certain champs relevant.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Nexus Reclamation Workshop\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA clandestine **tech-jungle reclamation workshop**, hidden beneath the neon-lit sprawl of a cyberpunk city. The space was once an illegal e-waste processing hub, but has been repurposed by a rogue engineering collective to salvage and retrofit decommissioned **combat drones** (reminiscent of League of Legends' \"jungle camps\"). The workshop is in disarray—half-assembled drones, jury-rigged power systems, and stacks of scavenged components create an environment where **collaborative problem-solving is mandatory**.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Machinery:** Some drone frames require coordinated lifting.  \n- **Precision Timing:** Power fluctuations demand synchronized actions.  \n- **Security & Scavenging:** Multiple entry points require simultaneous monitoring.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe workshop is a **converted underground garage**, divided into:  \n\n1. **Main Workfloor** – Cluttered with drone husks, welding stations, and tool racks.  \n2. **Power Junction Nook** – A jury-rigged electrical hub with exposed wiring.  \n3. **Storage & Scrap Pile** – A maze of labeled crates and loose components.  \n4. **Security Overlook** – A raised platform with flickering surveillance monitors.  \n5. **Back-Alley Entrance** – A rusted roll-up door leading to smuggling tunnels.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Workfloor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Central Workbench (3m x 1.5m, steel surface, scorch marks)** – Dominates the space, bolted to the floor.  \n- **Overhead Gantry Crane (capacity: 500kg, manual pulley system)** – Rusted but functional.  \n- **\"Jungle Core\" (repurposed server rack, missing panels, blinking LEDs)** – Acts as a makeshift drone AI core.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Half-Assembled Warframe Drone (320kg, missing left armature, exposed hydraulics)** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Calibration Terminal (glitchy touchscreen, requires login)** – Displays error: *\"Mastermune Firmware Corrupted.\"*  \n- **Tool Wall (magnetic strips holding wrenches, plasma cutters, a biometric screwdriver missing its battery)** – One tool is always just out of reach.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Welding Torch (fuel at 23%, hose slightly kinked)**  \n- **Parts Bin (labeled \"S3 Retrofit Kit,\" mostly empty, contains one loose capacitor)**  \n- **Emergency Stop Button (painted red, slightly sticky from old soda residue)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti on wall: \"RITO FIX THIS\" next to a crude Warwick doodle.**  \n- **Dented coffee mug (\"World's Best Jungler\") holding loose screws.**  \n- **Stack of outdated e-sports betting slips under a monitor.**  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Power Junction Nook**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Breaker Panel (rusted, half-open, mismatched fuses)**  \n- **Tesla Coil Array (humming, occasional static arcs, \"DO NOT TOUCH\" scratched into housing)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Overloaded Capacitor Bank (hot to the touch, needs replacement, but replacements are in Storage)**  \n- **Improvised UPS Battery (leaking acid, requires two agents to lift safely)**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Flickering Neon Sign (\"Nexus Reclamation Co.\")**  \n- **Extension Cord (partially melted, wrapped in duct tape)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old takeout containers (one has chopsticks stuck in it like a shrine).**  \n- **A poster of a pro gamer with \"BORING META\" angrily scribbled over it.**  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Warframe Drone (320kg, bulky shape)** – Requires two agents to maneuver without damaging the floor.  \n- **Improvised UPS Battery (180kg, hazardous)** – Must be carried carefully to avoid acid spills.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five capacitor banks**, only one has **blue insulation tape and a \"Zeta-9\" serial**—the correct replacement. The rest are mismatched or fried.  \n  - A **decorative blue coolant bottle** nearby acts as a distractor—similar color, wrong function.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - The **locked \"Mastermune\" firmware terminal** requires a keycard, which is **wedged under a toolbox in Storage**.  \n  - The **welding torch** can be used to **seal a leaking coolant line**, but only if the power is first rerouted via the breaker panel.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes:**  \nThis scene is a **dense, chaotic playground** for multi-agent collaboration. Every object has **purpose**, every detail **hides a potential task**, and the entire space **feels like a lived-in, dysfunctional workshop**. Agents must **communicate, coordinate, and problem-solve** to navigate the mess—just like a real, unbalanced jungle meta.  \n\nWould you like any refinements or additional layers of interaction?"
