Now Exchange 2003 is gone, and I can't find any utility that can perform this move.\n\nHow can this be done when there are no more Exchange 2003 servers in the organization?\n\nshare|improve this question\nSo you didn't replicate the public folder data over to the new 07 server before decomissioning? Or you replicated the data over, but haven't updated the hierarchy? I've got a bunch of links that may or may not help, I'm just trying to understand the problem better... –  Holocryptic Feb 24 '11 at 23:25\nPF data has been replicated, and the PF store on the Exchange 2003 server has been decommissioned (as had been the server, too). But the main folder container in AD, which is usually stored under \"First Administrative Group\", has not been moved from there to the new Exchange Administrative Group. This can clearly be seen from AD Sites & Services and/or from ADSIEdit. –  Massimo Feb 25 '11 at 7:48\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 2 down vote accepted\n\nI ended up installing the Exchange 2003 administrative tools on a Windows Server 2003 computer and moving the container using Exchange 2003's System Manager, as would be the case in a standard 2003-2007 transition.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Forgotten Server Room\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA dimly lit, labyrinthine server room in a corporate office building, housing aging IT infrastructure left behind after a rushed migration to a new system. The space is a relic of outdated technology—racks of decommissioned servers, tangled cables, and forgotten administrative tools. This environment is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy Equipment:** Large server racks and obsolete hardware require multiple agents to move or reconfigure.  \n- **Complex Troubleshooting:** Interconnected systems with legacy configurations demand coordinated diagnosis.  \n- **Hidden Artifacts:** Critical components (like administrative keys or backup drives) are scattered, necessitating search and retrieval.  \n\nThe scene is designed for tasks such as:  \n- **Server Migration:** Safely transporting fragile hardware.  \n- **Legacy Data Recovery:** Identifying and extracting specific drives from a mess of similar-looking hardware.  \n- **System Repairs:** Diagnosing and fixing faulty connections in a dense cable jungle.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe server room is divided into four interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Main Server Floor**  \n   - A cavernous space filled with rows of server racks, humming cooling units, and flickering status lights. The floor is a maze of cable trays and loose wires.  \n\n2. **Legacy Workstation Corner**  \n   - A cramped nook with an old **Windows Server 2003 admin terminal**, a **dusty CRT monitor**, and stacks of **outdated installation CDs**.  \n\n3. **Storage & Spare Parts Closet**  \n   - A cluttered side room with **cardboard boxes of decommissioned hard drives**, **unlabeled toolboxes**, and **a broken hydraulic dolly**.  \n\n4. **Network Hub & Junction Box**  \n   - A wall-mounted panel of **switches, patch cables, and a half-disconnected UPS** with a blinking \"FAULT\" light.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Server Floor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Primary Server Rack (E-23):** A 2.5m tall, 400kg steel rack housing **12 blade servers**, **two legacy Exchange 2003 nodes (labeled \"DO NOT POWER DOWN\")**, and a **rusted lockbox bolted to the side**.  \n- **Cooling Unit Delta-7:** An industrial-grade AC unit with a **partially detached vent hose**, dripping condensation into a shallow puddle.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Exchange 2003 Hierarchy Container (Physical Backup):** A **3.5\" floppy disk** taped under the server rack, labeled **\"FYDIBOHF23SPDLT – DO NOT LOSE\"** in faded marker.  \n- **Faulty Power Distribution Unit (PDU):** A 20kg **Tripp-Lite PDU** with **two blown fuses**, emitting a faint burning smell.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Cable Tester (Fluke Pro3000):** Left on a rolling cart, its **battery at 12%**.  \n- **Emergency Shutoff Switch:** A **red button** behind a cracked plastic cover.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated Safety Poster:** \"Y2K Compliance Checklist\" peeling off the wall.  \n- **Half-Drank Energy Drink:** A stale **\"Server Fuel\" brand can** on a dusty monitor.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Legacy Workstation Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Admin Terminal (Dell OptiPlex GX520):** A **Windows Server 2003** login screen frozen at \"Applying Group Policy.\"  \n- **Obsolete Tape Backup Drive (Quantum DLT-4000):** A **50kg unit** with a **jammed cartridge**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Exchange 2003 Admin Toolkit CD:** A scratched disc in a **paper sleeve**, labeled **\"E2K3 MIGRATE – LAST COPY.\"**  \n- **Password Sticky Note:** Hidden under the keyboard: **\"PFAdmin / B@ckup#1\"**.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **USB-to-Serial Adapter:** Plugged into the tower, **loose connection**.  \n- **Ergonomic Keyboard:** Missing the **\"W\" key**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed \"Employee of the Month\" Photo (2004):** Faded, cracked glass.  \n- **Stack of 90s Tech Magazines:** \"PC World – Y2K Survival Guide\" on top.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Storage & Spare Parts Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Decommissioned Server Pile:** A **precarious stack of Sun Microsystems boxes**, one labeled **\"First Administrative Group – Legacy PF Store.\"**  \n- **Broken Hydraulic Dolly:** A **150kg transport cart** with a **bent wheel**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed Anti-Static Bag:** Contains **the missing \"W\" key** from the workstation keyboard.  \n- **Mystery Hard Drive Array:** **Five identical 1TB drives**, but **only one** has a **red \"CORROSIVE EXPOSURE – DO NOT MOUNT\"** sticker.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label Maker (Brother PT-90):** Out of tape, **last label stuck inside**.  \n- **Dust-Covered Toolbox:** Contains **a working multimeter** under **loose screws**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Stale Coffee Mug:** \"World’s Okayest Sysadmin\" in chipped lettering.  \n- **Empty Pizza Box:** From \"Bits & Bytes Pizzeria.\"  \n\n---  \n\n#### **D.

Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Mislabeled Patch Cable:** **A blue Cat-6 cable** plugged into **Port 13**, tagged **\"TEMPORARY.\"**  \n- **Spare Fuses (for PDU):** In a **small plastic bin**, **two of five missing**.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Portable Work Light:** **Flickering LED**, **loose battery cover**.  \n- **Cable Crimper:** **Jaw misaligned**, needs adjustment.  \n\n**d.
