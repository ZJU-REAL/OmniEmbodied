I believe I installed Ubuntu over Windows on my Acer netbook. I then tried to install Linux Mint, but it wouldn't start installing. I turned the netbook off and back on. Now I get the error.\n\nI have read a lot of other questions like this, but in my case I cannot boot a CD. If I put a Ubuntu CD or a Linux Mint CD into my external CD/DVD drive and change my BIOS to boot the CD-ROM first, it just gives me the same error screen.\n\nHere are some results from using the ls command:\n\ngrub rescue>ls (hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos1) \ngrub rescue>ls (hd0,msdos5) unknown filesystem \ngrub rescue>ls (hd0,msdos1) unknown filesystem \ngrub rescue>ls (hd0) unknown filesystem \n\nCan anyone get me back into Ubuntu and make this error go away?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\nmarked as duplicate by belacq, Warren Hill, Sneetsher, bain, psusi Jul 1 at 18:59\n\n\ndo you have ubuntu live ISO in internal hard drive? –  virpara May 26 '12 at 2:45\nIf there is no defect in either your Ubuntu or Mint install CDs then either your hardware is broken or your BIOS is simply not trying to boot from the CD even though you think you told it to do that. Please take a look at the troubleshooting suggestions listed on the BootFromCD help page. –  irrational John May 27 '12 at 2:07\nI did what this answer said to do, but instead of (hd0,1) I put (hd0,3). I suggest trying that command with 1-6 instead of just 1 or 0. But try 0 too. –  user85203 Aug 24 '12 at 1:06\n\n6 Answers 6\n\nFirst boot into Ubuntu from an ISO image.\n\n  1. Locate the Ubuntu partition and the folder containing the GRUB modules.\n\n    The GRUB folder containing the modules must be located so the correct modules can be loaded. This folder would have been created during the initial installation of Ubuntu and should be located in the Ubuntu partition. This folder would normally be located at either (hdX,Y)/boot/grub or (hdX,Y)/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc. Find your existing Ubuntu partition and the module folder.\n\n    ls                               # List the known drives (hdX) and partitions (hdX,Y)\n    ls (hdX,Y)/                      # List the contents of the partition's root\n    ls (hdX,Y)/boot/grub             # Normal location of the Grub 2 modules.\n    ls (hdX,Y)/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc  # Alternate location of the Grub 2 modules.\n    • If you get an \"error: unknown filesystem\" this is not your Ubuntu partition.\n    • If this is the Ubuntu partition, you will see the Ubuntu folders, including lost+found/, home/, boot/ and vmlinuz and initrd.img. Use this address as the first part of the next command.\n    • ls (hdX,Y)/boot/grub - should display several dozen *.mod files. This is the folder you are looking for.\n  2. Load the modules.\n\n    set prefix=(hdX,Y)/<path to modules>\n    • This command must correctly point to the folder containing the GRUB modules. The address should be the one in the previous section which displayed the modules.\n\n\n    set prefix=(hd0,5)/boot/grub \n    set prefix=(hd1,1)/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc\n    • Load modules:\n\n      insmod linux\n      insmod loopback\n      insmod iso9660\n      insmod fat        # If ISO is located on fat16 or fat32 formatted partition.\n      insmod nftscomp   # If NTFS compression is used on the partition. Load if you aren't sure.\n    • A \"file not found\" error means that the path in the prefix is incorrect or the specific module does not exist. The prefix setting may be reviewed with the set command. Rerun the \"set prefix=\" command with the proper path.\n\n  3. Locate the Ubuntu ISO file.\n\n    • Using the combinations of ls commands, locate the Ubuntu ISO image.\n  4. Create the loopback device.\n\n    loopback loop (hdX,Y)/<path to ISO>/<ISO-name.iso>\n    • Example:\n\n      loopback loop (hd1,1)/path/to/ubuntu-10.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\n  5. Load the Linux kernel and initrd image.\n\n    set root=(loop)\n    linux /casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/<ISO-name.iso> noprompt noeject\n    initrd /casper/initrd.lz\n    • If the path to the ISO or filename is not correct, the boot will halt at the BusyBox screen and produce a message stating \"can't open /dev/sr0: No medium found\".\n    • Note: If the ISO file is not in the / folder, include the path in the iso-scan/filename= entry. See second example.\n    • Examples:\n\n      linux /casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/ubuntu-10.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\n      linux /casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/my-iso/ubuntu-10.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\n  6. Boot.\n\n    That should be it. If the commands ran without any messages/errors, the commands were accepted as entered. It's now time to boot:\n\n\n\nNow do this after booting:\n\nHow to fix: error:unknown file system grub rescue? is post with the same problem and is solved as below,\n\n  1. sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt\n\n    Here, sdaX is your boot partition. You can get a list with sudo blkid like this,\n\n    /dev/sda1: LABEL=\"Windows XP\" UUID=\"96A4390DA438F0FB\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n    /dev/sda3: LABEL=\"Ubuntu 11.04\" UUID=\"b61fcae3-7744-45b4-95b9-7528d50a3652\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n    /dev/sda5: LABEL=\"Se7en\" UUID=\"A2DC9D71DC9D4109\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n    /dev/sda6: LABEL=\"Development\" UUID=\"DEB455A1B4557CC9\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n    /dev/sda7: LABEL=\"EXTRA\" UUID=\"D8A04109A040F014\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n    /dev/sda8: LABEL=\"SONG\" UUID=\"46080FCD080FBAC7\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n    /dev/sda9: LABEL=\"BACKUPS\" UUID=\"766E-BC99\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n\n    Note: sdaX must be Linux partition.\n\n  2. sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\n\n  3. sudo update-grub\n\nshare|improve this answer\nwhen I use the sudo blkid it says \"Unknow command \"sudo\" –  Hjke123 May 26 '12 at 3:00\nAs I said ^^ I can't do the sudo command. –  Hjke123 May 26 '12 at 3:14\nblkid and all this with sudo is pricess to do after booting into live image. –  virpara May 26 '12 at 3:32\nIs there any way to repair grub without installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu? –  TheRookierLearner Jul 9 at 5:21\n\nThese steps solved the issue. I am having Windows 7 & Ubuntu 10.04. After running steps on the below I don't need to run these every time and able to boot OSs normally:\n\n  1. set root=(hd0,6)\n  2. set prefix=(hd0,6)/boot/grub\n  3. insmod normal\n  4. normal\n  5. sudo update-grub (Run this in terminal after getting into Ubuntu)\n  6. sudo grub-install /dev/sda (Run this in terminal after getting into Ubuntu)\n\nTake into consideration that the hd0 could be X (0,1,2..) depending on the order of disks and the 6 could be also different, it could be (hd0,gpt7), for example.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThis got me to my grub menu, thanks dude! –  Eric Dec 14 '12 at 9:48\nI have a MacBook Air with Ubuntu and OSX, this solved my issues after the OSX Mavericks update! –  Murphy Oct 24 '13 at 12:12\nThanks a lot. ( @Hjke123 this should be the accepted answer ! While the first post gives hints on how to get the Ubuntu disk/partition IDs ...) –  ring0 May 8 at 9:08\nExcellent. These steps solved by issue. Just make sure that /dev/sda is your harddisk, which is the case most of the time. –  palerdot Jul 11 at 16:34\n\nBoot your system from the Ubuntu Live CD and try this, it worked wonders for me.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nCan you elaborate? –  Peter Mortensen Oct 31 '13 at 18:17\n\nBefore reading: The answer below is meant for Ubuntu users who have just updated/recovered/reinstalled/installed OS X. It's likely that the answer will work if this isn't the case (for example, if there are any inconsistencies in your partition table), but I'm not sure.\n\nFor me, this happened after updating to OS X Mavericks (10.9). Basically what may have happened is that OS X created a recovery partition (\"Recovery HD\") that the system only detects sometimes. For example, GParted in Ubuntu will see the recovery partition fine, but when listing the partitions in terminal (fdisk -l), you may not see the partitions.\n\nDiagnosing the issue: Did the OS X update/format/recovery cause this problem?\n\nIn order to diagnose that this is indeed the case, first use GRUB rescue to boot into Ubuntu. In order to do this, follow this page or see if any of the other answers on this question can get you into Ubuntu. For me, running the below commands temporarily allowed me to boot the correct partition. Depending on how your hard drives and partitions are set up, it may vary:\n\ngrub rescue> insmod normal\ngrub rescue> normal\n\nNow, log in to Ubuntu and check GParted. If you see the recovery partition, open up a terminal and type fdisk -l to see if that detects the recovery partition. If it doesn't list the same partitions, check the device/partition column and see if those also don't match up (for example, in GParted your boot partition may be /dev/sda4, but it is /dev/sda3 when running fdisk). If this is the case, keep reading. If it's not, it looks like your partitions are lined up correctly. You can either choose to keep reading and follow the instructions (which, if GRUB was working before the restore/reinstall/etc..., this should work properly), or just reinstall GRUB on the right partition.\n\nFixing it by removing/merging the recovery partition\n\nTo fix this issue, what we want to do is get rid of the recovery partition - it's causing issues and inconsistencies, and removing it shouldn't cause damage. Ideally you want to merge it with the normal HFS+ OS X partition, so follow this question and answer here. After merging, GRUB should be back to normal.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nThis happened to me after I delete a partition that was located before the /boot partition.\n\nTo fix it, I ran an Ubuntu live USB stick, mounted the root partition to /mnt and the boot partition to /mnt/boot, and I ran this command (replace /dev/sda with the correct hard disk):\n\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour external CD/DVD is probably a USB device. You probably cannot tell BIOS to boot from it. When you start the ACER wacth for a message at the bottom (or top) of the screen saying something like \"F2 to enter Setup, F12 for a Boot Menu\". When you know what you need to press for the Boot Menu, put the CD in your external device, turn on or reboot the machine and slowly mash that key until you get a temporary menu allowing you to boot from the external CD.\n\nYou may need to use gparted from the CD to examine your hard drive and decide what to do to fix it so you can use it. That's beyond what I can describe here\n\nshare|improve this answer\nHere are some results from my commands : grub rescue> ls (hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos1) grub rescue>ls (hd0,msdos5) unknown filesystem grub rescue>ls (hd0,msdos1) unknown filesystem grub rescue>ls (hd0) unknown filesystem I don't know if this will mean anything to anyone trying to help and thanks for the response I will check –  Hjke123 May 26 '12 at 2:54\n\nprotected by Community Oct 3 '12 at 7:26\n\n\nWould you like to answer one of these unanswered questions instead?\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The GRUB Repair Lab\"**  \n**Inspiration Text:** *A tech support thread about recovering a corrupted GRUB bootloader, involving partition exploration, module loading, and manual system repair.*  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA cluttered, high-stakes **computer repair lab** specializing in emergency data recovery and OS restoration. The lab is mid-way through diagnosing a critical bootloader failure on a client’s machine, with partitions scrambled and time-sensitive data at risk. The environment is **inherently collaborative**—heavy server racks need moving, partitioned drives require simultaneous inspection, and delicate component repairs demand one agent to stabilize while another works.  \n\n**Key Challenges:**  \n- **Physical Collaboration:** Server units are too heavy for one person; drive arrays need alignment.  \n- **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Identifying the correct drive partition among many (e.g., matching UUID labels, checking filesystem errors).  \n- **Tool-Use Puzzles:** Repair requires specific tools (e.g., a USB flasher buried under clutter, a screwdriver with a magnetic tip).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Key Areas**  \nA compact but dense lab with three zones:  \n\n1. **Main Workbench**  \n   - Central repair station with disassembled PCs, scattered diagnostic tools, and a flickering overhead lamp.  \n2. **Drive Storage Wall**  \n   - Floor-to-ceiling shelves of labeled HDDs/SSDs in anti-static bags, with a rolling ladder for access.  \n3. **Server Cluster Corner**  \n   - A humming rack of 4U servers, one slid out halfway with exposed internals.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Area 1: Main Workbench**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A steel worktable (2m x 1m) with a scratched surface, bolted to the floor. Mounted with a vise grip and a magnifying lamp (arm length: 60cm, adjustable).  \n- A wheeled tool chest (5 drawers, one jammed shut) with a dented side.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Faulty Client Laptop**: Acer netbook, lid open, screen displaying `grub rescue>`. The SSD (Samsung 870 EVO, 1TB) is externally connected via a SATA-to-USB adapter (loose connection).  \n- **Diagnostic Toolkit**:  \n  - USB flasher (SanDisk Cruzer, 32GB, labeled \"Ubuntu 22.04 LIVE\") wedged under a keyboard.  \n  - Precision screwdriver set (10 bits, magnetic tip missing from slot #4).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A powered USB hub (4 ports, 2 occupied by mouse/keyboard).  \n- An open binder with printed partition tables (page 3 dog-eared, coffee stain obscuring one UUID).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- A dead potted cactus on the table’s edge.  \n- A sticky note on the monitor: \"CALL BACK CLIENT #4821 – URGENT.\"  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Area 2: Drive Storage Wall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- Industrial shelving (2.5m tall, 3 shelves). Top shelf holds a dusty box of IDE cables (obsolete).  \n- A rolling ladder (weight limit: 150kg) stuck midway due to a warped wheel.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Misplaced Boot Drive**: A 2.5\" SSD (WD Blue, 500GB, UUID `b61fcae3-...`) in an unlabeled anti-static bag (shelf B3, buried under three identical bags).  \n- **External Enclosure**: A toolless HDD dock (Orico 3568) with a broken latch.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Label maker (Brother PT-E100, out of tape).  \n- A functional but noisy air duster can (30% full, nozzle bent).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- A 2006 \"Defragmentation Best Practices\" poster peeling off the wall.  \n- A coffee mug (text: \"WORLD’S OKAYEST TECH\") holding mismatched screws.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Area 3: Server Cluster Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- A 42U server rack (1.8m tall) with one server (Dell PowerEdge R740) partially slid out (requires 2+ agents to lift fully).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Recovery Server**:  \n  - Displaying `error: unknown filesystem` on its KVM monitor.  \n  - One drive bay (slot #3) has a loose SAS cable (needs reseating).  \n- **Network Tools**:  \n  - A crimped Ethernet cable (length: 2m) dangling from the rack.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A rack-mounted LCD (showing a network topology map; frozen).  \n- A stack of spare drive caddies (one missing a screw).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- A sticky note on the rack: \"DO NOT POWER OFF – PATCHING IN PROGRESS.\"  \n- A half-eaten granola bar on the UPS unit.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Embedded Collaboration & Reasoning Affordances**  \n\n**1. Collaborative Transportation:**  \n- **Server Rack Unit**: The Dell R740 weighs **48kg**; its rails are misaligned, requiring one agent to stabilize while another adjusts.  \n- **Ladder Movement**: The jammed ladder wheel needs one agent to lift (20kg force) while another pries it loose with a flathead screwdriver.  \n\n**2. Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n- **Identifying the Boot Drive**: Among five SSDs on the shelf, the target has:  \n  - A **scratch near the SATA port**.  \n  - A **handwritten label** (\"Backup 04/2023\") under the official sticker.  \n  - **Distractor**: A near-identical SSD with a smudged label.  \n\n**3. Compound Tool-Use:**  \n- **Problem**: The USB flasher lacks a bootable ISO.  \n  - **Solution Chain**:  \n    1. Find the **SanDisk Cruzer** (buried under clutter).  \n    2. Use the **lab PC** (login passcode taped under the keyboard) to download the ISO.  \n    3. **Verify checksum** against a sticky note on the monitor.  \n\n---  \n\n**Atmosphere & Nuance**:  \n- The hum of servers mixes with a **dripping sound** from a leaky AC unit.  \n- A **flickering LED** in the corner casts intermittent shadows, complicating fine screw work.  \n- The **smell of ozone** lingers near the overloaded power strip.  \n\n**Why This Works for AI Agents**:  \n- Every object has **multiple interaction layers** (physical, stateful, informational).  \n- Tasks require **spatial coordination** (e.g., holding vs. repairing).  \n- **Distractors** (e.g., near-identical drives) force precise attribute checks.  \n\n---  \n**Final Note**: This scene turns abstract \"GRUB repair\" steps into a **tactile, urgent environment** where collaboration is mandatory, and every detail matters."
