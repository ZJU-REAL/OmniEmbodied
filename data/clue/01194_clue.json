The acceptor threads accept the connection and put it into the connection queue. Then, request processing threads take the connection in the connection queue and process the request. For more information, see Connection-Handling Overview.\n\nConnection queue information shows the number of sessions in the connection queue, and the average delay before the connection is accepted by the request processing thread.\n\nThe following is an example of how these statistics are displayed in perfdump:\n\nCurrent/Peak/Limit Queue Length            0/1853/160032\nTotal Connections Queued                   11222922\nAverage Queue Length (1, 5, 15 minutes)    90.35, 89.64, 54.02\nAverage Queueing Delay                     4.80 milliseconds\n\nThe following table shows the information displayed in the Admin Console when accessing monitoring information for the server instance:\n\nTable 2–1 Connection Queue Statistics\n\nPresent Number of Connections Queued \n\nTotal Number of Connections Queued \n\n\nAverage Connections Over Last 1 Minute \n\n\nAverage Connections Over Last 5 Minutes \n\n\nAverage Connections Over Last 15 Minutes \n\n\nMaximum Queue Size \n\n\nPeak Queue Size \n\n\nNumber of Connections Overflowed \n\nTicks Spent \n\n\nTotal Number of Connections Added \n\n\nCurrent /Peak /Limit Queue Length\n\nCurrent/Peak/Limit queue length shows, in order:\n\n\nIf the peak queue length, also known as the maximum queue size, is close to the limit, you can increase the maximum connection queue size to avoid dropping connections under heavy load.\n\nTotal Connections Queued\n\nTotal Connections Queued is the total number of times a connection has been queued. This number includes newly-accepted connections and connections from the keep-alive system.\n\nThis setting is not tunable.\n\nAverage Queue Length\n\nThe Average Queue Length shows the average number of connections in the queue over the most recent one-minute, five-minute, and 15-minute intervals.\n\nThis setting is not tunable.\n\nAverage Queuing Delay\n\nThe Average Queueing Delay is the average amount of time a connection spends in the connection queue. This represents the delay between when a request connection is accepted by the server and when a request processing thread begins servicing the request. It is the Ticks Spent divided by the Total Connections Queued, and converted to milliseconds.\n\nThis setting is not tunable.\n\nTicks Spent\n\nA tick is a system-dependent value and provided by the tickPerSecond attribute of the server element in stats.xml. The ticks spent value is the total amount of time that connections spent in the connection queue and is used to calculate the average queuing delay.\n\nThis setting is not tunable.\n\nTotal Number of Connections Added\n\nThe new connections added to the connection queue. This setting is not tunable.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: The Overloaded Network Operations Center (NOC)**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThis is a high-stakes **Network Operations Center (NOC)** responsible for managing a global web infrastructure. The room is alive with urgency—servers hum, screens flicker with error logs, and a backlog of unprocessed requests threatens to crash critical services.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment:** Server racks, backup batteries, and emergency cooling systems require coordinated physical handling.  \n- **Time-Sensitive Debugging:** Multiple specialists (network engineers, hardware techs, security analysts) must collaborate to diagnose and reroute traffic.  \n- **Resource Scarcity:** Limited tools (like diagnostic cables or spare drives) must be shared efficiently.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe NOC is divided into four functional zones:  \n\n1. **Main Monitoring Hub** – A semicircular desk with **12 wall-mounted displays** showing real-time traffic dashboards, error heatmaps, and queue depths.  \n2. **Server Farm** – A dense cluster of **8 server racks**, each with blinking status LEDs. Some emit warning beeps.  \n3. **Maintenance & Tool Bay** – A cluttered workbench with diagnostic tools, spare parts, and a locked cabinet for sensitive components.  \n4. **Break/Storage Nook** – A small area with a fridge (half-stocked with energy drinks), a whiteboard covered in hastily scribbled IP addresses, and a **stack of old hard drives awaiting disposal**.  \n\n---\n\n### **3.
