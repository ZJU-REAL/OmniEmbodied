Moments later poel-sitter Pedrosa lowsided out of the lead, handing the advantage to Stoner.\n\nThe Australian then rode steadily into the distance, building an advantage of over eight-seconds on his way to his sixth win of the year - extending his title lead over Lorenzo from 20 to32 points.\n\nDespite a stubborn resistance, world champion Lorenzo was caught and passed by Italians Dovizioso and Simoncelli, with Dovizioso gaining breathing room over his compatriot in the closing stages.\n\nFormer 250cc world champion Simoncelli, who has crashed in five races this year and been penalised in another, finally claimed his debut MotoGP rostrum after withstanding late-race pressure from Lorenzo.\n\nBen Spies - struggling with a pinched nerve in his neck this weekend - brought the second factory M1 home in fifth, 1.6sec from Lorenzo.\n\nValentino Rossi lost places from his best Ducati qualifying of sixth, but - aided by Pedrosa's exit - recovered the ground lost and crossed the line 2.4sec from Yamaha replacement Spies and 12.6sec from victory.\n\nSuzuki's Alvaro Bautista - the only rider other than Lorenzo to choose the soft front - pressured Rossi for much of the race, before lowsiding from seventh place with six laps to go.\n\nThat allowed Rossi's team-mate Nicky Hayden to inherit the position, having spent much of the race just ahead of fellow American Colin Edwards.\n\nEdwards' Monster Yamaha Tech 3 team-mate Cal Crutchlow joined Pedrosa and Bautista on the DNF list, as did fellow rookie Karel Abraham.\n\nAbraham, whose father and team manager owns the Brno team, was unable to finish his home race after an off-track moment was followed by an engine failure.\n\nBautista's wild-card team-mate John Hopkins was forced to withdraw from the event after fracturing fingers in his right hand during Saturday morning practice.\n\nA test session will be held at the circuit on Monday, which will feature next year's 1000cc bikes from Honda and Yamaha.\n\nCzech Republic Grand Prix:\n\n1.

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: MotoGP Pit Garage & Race Control Hub**  \n\n**Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThis is a high-stakes, high-energy **MotoGP pit garage and race control hub**, where a team of engineers, mechanics, and strategists must collaborate under extreme time pressure to maintain, repair, and optimize motorcycles during a live race. The environment is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Heavy machinery** requiring multiple people to move or adjust.  \n- **Specialized tool use** (some tasks require simultaneous actions).  \n- **Time-sensitive decision-making** (race telemetry, pit stop coordination).  \n- **Safety hazards** (hot engines, spilled fuel, sharp tools).  \n\nThe scene is **densely packed** with tools, spare parts, diagnostic equipment, and real-time data feeds—creating a chaotic but structured workspace where every object has a purpose.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n1. **Main Pit Garage (Primary Work Area)**  \n   - A long, open-fronted garage with a retractable awning.  \n   - Dominated by a **central workbench** with **two motorcycles** (one race-ready, one under repair).  \n   - **Tool racks**, **hydraulic lifts**, and **fueling stations** line the walls.  \n   - **Overhead**—live race footage on monitors, a whiteboard with lap times.  \n\n2. **Diagnostic & Telemetry Station**  \n   - A **cluttered desk** with **three monitors** displaying engine telemetry, tire wear, and competitor positions.  \n   - **Wires snake across the floor**, connecting to data loggers on the bikes.  \n   - A **printer spits out lap reports** in real time.  \n\n3. **Parts & Storage Room (Adjacent to Garage)**  \n   - **Wall-mounted shelves** filled with labeled **tire sets, brake pads, and engine components**.  \n   - A **locked cabinet** for high-value electronics (ECUs, sensors).  \n   - A **mini-fridge** stocked with energy drinks—half-empty, condensation dripping.  \n\n4. **Pit Lane Entry Zone**  \n   - **Tire warmers** (glowing orange, 80°C) on a rolling rack.  \n   - A **fuel rig** (20L jerrycans, safety warnings in Czech and English).  \n   - A **stretcher and first-aid kit** mounted on the wall (unused but visibly dusty).  \n\n5. **Back Office (Strategy Room)**  \n   - **Maps of the Brno circuit** with handwritten notes.  \n   - A **coffee-stained clipboard** holding rider feedback forms.  \n   - **A broken chair** (one wheel missing, tilted precariously).  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Pit Garage**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Hydraulic motorcycle lift** (max load 300kg, currently raised 1m off ground).  \n- **Dual workbenches** (steel, scratched, with built-in vise grips).  \n- **Overhead LED lighting rig** (one flickering bulb, casting uneven shadows).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Race Bike #27 (Primary Bike)**  \n  - **Damaged front fairing** (cracked near left mirror, held by zip ties).  \n  - **Tire pressure gauge** (digital, reading 2.1 bar—needs adjustment).  \n  - **Fuel hose** (disconnected, dripping residue).  \n- **Spare Bike #27B (Backup Bike)**  \n  - **Fresh soft-compound tires** (labeled \"SOFT-12,\" still in warmers).  \n  - **Missing rear brake caliper** (left on the workbench).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Pneumatic impact wrench** (hissing slightly, air line attached).  \n- **Laptop** (running diagnostics, screen showing \"ERROR: Throttle Sensor\").  \n- **Fire extinguisher** (mounted, last inspected 3 months ago).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed photo** of last year’s podium (dusty, slightly crooked).  \n- **Empty energy drink cans** (crushed, in a wire bin).  \n- **Grease-stained race gloves** (tossed on a shelf).  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Diagnostic & Telemetry Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Triple-monitor setup** (middle screen frozen on lap 7 data).  \n- **Server rack** (humming, LEDs blinking erratically).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Live telemetry feed** (showing rider #27’s **dropping RPM**).  \n- **Headset/microphone** (for pit-wall communication, left on mute).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Sticky notes** with tire pressures scribbled in marker.  \n- **Spare keyboard** (missing the \"E\" key).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Poster** of Brno circuit layout (corner speeds highlighted).  \n- **Half-eaten sandwich** (wrapped in foil, forgotten).  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n**1. Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The hydraulic lift (300kg)** requires **two people** to lower safely while stabilizing the bike.  \n- **The spare engine block (85kg)** is too heavy for one mechanic—must be carried with a partner.  \n\n**2. Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five tire sets**, only **SOFT-12** is marked with **blue tape** (for qualifying). The rest are race tires (black labels).  \n  - **Distractor:** A **blue shop towel** is crumpled nearby—agents must ignore it.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **throttle sensor error** requires a **specialized calibration tool** (stored in the locked cabinet).  \n  - **Solution:** The **keycard** is hidden under the keyboard at the telemetry station.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis environment is **bursting with potential tasks**:  \n- **Emergency tire change** (must coordinate warmers, tools, and cleanup).  \n- **Diagnosing the stuck throttle** (requiring telemetry analysis and part replacement).  \n- **Prepping the backup bike** (under time pressure before the rider pits).  \n\nThe **clutter, noise, and time pressure** force agents to **filter distractions**, **communicate clearly**, and **prioritize dynamically**—making it a perfect testbed for embodied AI collaboration."
