Please see this blog entry\n\nshare|improve this answer\nYou're absolutely right. So, does every C# programmer manually \"trim-off\" any \"0x\" (if present) or is there a short-cut? BTW: I'll accept this as solution as soon as SO allows me :-) –  S.C. Madsen May 10 '10 at 9:27\nWow. That's close to a bug I would say. –  kenny May 10 '10 at 9:53\n@S.C. Madsen: I think I did \"trim-off\" \"manually\" when I needed this functionality in an earlier project. Not pretty, but worked well... –  Peter May 10 '10 at 11:40\nPeter: I've gone and done the same in my application. I really think this is a major short-coming of the TryParse() method. –  S.C. Madsen May 10 '10 at 17:54\nFrom NumberStyles Enumeration, AllowHexSpecifier: Strings that are parsed using this style cannot be prefixed with \"0x\" or \"&h\". –  DavidRR Sep 11 at 20:25\n// stupid but effective way to improve the parsing\nchar[] _trim_hex = new char[] {'0','x'};\nint temp;\n\nif (int.TryParse(value.TrimStart(_trim_hex), NumberStyles.HexNumber, null, out temp))\n    // temp is good\nshare|improve this answer\n\nGet rid of the leading \"0x\" in the string you're trying to parse.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nSee also http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kadka85s%28v=VS.100%29.aspx In the example at the bottom of the page:\n\nAttempted conversion of '0x8F8C' failed.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Scene Type:** *Software Debugging Lab – \"The Hex Conundrum\"*  \n\n**Core Concept:** A specialized software development lab where engineers collaborate to diagnose and fix cryptic hexadecimal parsing errors in legacy systems. The lab is split into multiple workstations, each with distinct roles—code review, hardware testing, and documentation—requiring tight coordination to solve intricate technical puzzles.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Hardware:** Some equipment (server racks, diagnostic tools) is too bulky for one person.  \n- **Distributed Information:** Critical clues (manuals, error logs, schematics) are scattered across workstations, forcing intentional collaboration.  \n- **Tool Dependencies:** Fixing one issue often requires tools held by another team member.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n**Lab Layout:** A rectangular open-plan space divided into four zones:  \n1. **Code Review Station** – A cluster of standing desks with wall-mounted monitors displaying hexadecimal dumps.  \n2. **Hardware Test Bench** – A reinforced table with disassembled server components and diagnostic rigs.  \n3. **Documentation Archive** – Floor-to-ceiling shelves with binders, loose schematics, and a microfiche reader.  \n4. **Break/Whiteboard Area** – A cramped corner with a coffee-stained whiteboard covered in half-erased error codes.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Code Review Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Two *adjustable-height standing desks* (120cm × 80cm, matte black steel frames).  \n- A wall-mounted *55-inch 4K monitor* displaying a real-time hex dump stream (glowing green text on black).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Broken\" Legacy Terminal** (1970s-style, beige, with a sticky \"0x ERROR\" Post-it note).  \n- **Reference Manual** (*\"Hex Parsing Pitfalls, 3rd Ed.\"*, open to a dog-eared page about \"0x prefix bugs\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Wireless keyboard (missing the F3 key).  \n- A *thermal printer* intermittently spitting out error logs (paper jammed 30% of the time).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A *smashed coffee mug* repurposed as a holder for USB drives.  \n- A *framed photo* of the team at DEF CON, slightly crooked.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Hardware Test Bench**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A *steel-reinforced workbench* (2m long, bolted to the floor) with ESD mats.  \n- An *oscilloscope* (150kg, requires two people to lift) showing erratic signal noise.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Faulty Memory Module** (labeled *\"0x20 FAIL\"*, partially inserted into a test rig).  \n- **Calibration Tool** (locked in a small safe; combo written on a whiteboard in another room).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Soldering iron (cold, but plugged in).  \n- Bin of *assorted screws* (M3 and M4 mixed together).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A *dusty \"Employee of the Month\" plaque* from 1998.  \n- A *dead ficus plant* in the corner.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Documentation Archive**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Industrial shelving units (3m tall, overloaded with binders).  \n- A *microfiche reader* (1980s model, powered but displaying \"NO SIGNAL\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Lost\" Debugging Guide** (buried under a stack of outdated manuals; uniquely has a *blue \"URGENT\" tab*).  \n- **Locked Filing Cabinet** (key hidden inside a hollowed-out book titled *\"C# for Dummies\"*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A *label maker* (out of tape).  \n- A *stool* (one wobbly leg).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A *box of floppy disks* labeled \"BACKUP? DO NOT USE.\"  \n- A *fake security camera* (for \"psychological deterrence\").  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- The *oscilloscope (150kg)* cannot be moved solo—agents must coordinate lifting.  \n- A *server rack door* is jammed; one agent must hold it open while another retrieves a tool.  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among *five nearly identical memory modules*, only one has:  \n  - A *red Sharpie \"X\"* on its edge.  \n  - A *slightly bent pin*.  \n  - Background \"noise\" includes *four non-functional dummy modules* in the same bin.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - To fix the *broken terminal*, agents must:  \n    1. Find the *calibration tool* (locked in a safe).  \n    2. Retrieve the *combo* from the whiteboard.  \n    3. Avoid the *distractor numbers* (old coffee stains resembling digits).  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Notes:**  \nThe lab is *dense with intentional red herrings* (e.g., a \"0x\" scribbled on a napkin that means nothing) and *layered problems* (e.g., a printer jam that obscures a critical error log). Agents must *communicate, infer, and collaborate* to parse both the technical and physical puzzles."
