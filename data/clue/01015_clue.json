On the second night, however, Shehechiyanu is said before Leishev Basukkah.\n\nAccording to other minhagim: Leishev Basukkah is always said first.\n\nSo what's up with that? Why should one be said before the other? Which should normally be said first? And why the switch for me?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nThe proper order of these blessings is a machloket between Rav and Rabba bar bar Chana on Sukkah 56a. Rav held the blessing on the Sukkah comes first because it's the obligation of the day and Rabba bar bar Chana held that Shehechiyanu comes first because it is Tadir = said more often. The Rambam (Sukkah 6:2) rules like Rav and Shulchan Aruch does likewise in OC 643:1.\n\nThe Tur (OC 661) quotes two opinions regarding the second day. The Rosh holds that the order should be flipped and the Avi Ezri holds that the order should remain the same. At first glance the Avi Ezri makes the most sense: when else do we distinguish between the different days of Yom Tov? We say a Shehechiyanu on the day in case it is really the first day, shouldn't we say a Shehechiyanu on the Sukkah in case it is really our first time performing the mitzva?\n\nThe answer lies in the nature of the Shehechiyanu on the Sukkah. It is not being said on the new mitzva performance, but rather is said upon building the sukkah and can even be said many days before the holiday starts (OC 641, note also our custom to use the Shehechiyanu on the holiday to fulfill this obligation). Thus even if the second day really is the right day, we have already fulfilled the obligation of Shehechiyanu on the Sukkah the previous night. (This is also why we don't say a Shehechiyanu on the Lulav on the second day of Sukkot, but we do on the Shofar on the second day of Rosh HaShana.)\n\n(I'll note that neither Rav nor Rabba bar bar Chana seemed to care that the Shehechiyanu be after the Sukkah in order to have the Shehechiyanu apply to the Sukkah as well, ie Shehechiyanu should apply to everything by default anyway. Tzarich iyun on the Rosh IMO.)\n\nThe Shulchan Aruch and Rama rule like the Rosh, while Bach, Maharshal and Gra rule like the Avi Ezri (see more names on both sides in Shaar HaTziyun OC 661 sk 3) and hence the differences in custom.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nFirst night: say a leisheiv. Then say a shehechiyanu, as that is covering both the yomtov (shehechiyanu is part of the standard kiddush of the first 2 days of pesach and shavuos too), and the new experience of the mitzva of dwelling in the sukkah (just as you'd make a shehechiyanu the first time you take a lulav, but not subsequent times).\n\nSecond night: well as a rule of thumb on yomtov, the Sages enacted a shehechiyanu for the second-night-yomtov kiddush, to generate more respect for the second (rabbinically-enacted) day. However, it's not your first time saying a leisheiv. Therefore:\n\nCustom A: Make regular kiddush, including the standard second-day shehechiyanu. THEN, make a leisheiv, which will be immediately followed by your sitting down and drinking in the sukkah (so your \"dwelling in the sukkah\" came immediately after the blessing to do so).\n\nCustom B: We don't want people to treat the second day as any less special than the first day. The rest of the prayers are the same for both days. Therefore, say the exact same kiddush as day #1, i.e. concluding with shehechiyanu.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nI can answer your family Minhag based on the following logic:\n\nThe Shehehiyanu is on the Mitzvah. In the case of the first night, two Mitzvoth are being performed for the first time. In the second, the Mitzvah of \"dwelling\" in the Sukkah has already been performed. However, the Yom Tov and Kiddush obligate a Shehehiyanu.\n\nWhy you would say Shehehiyanu on Kiddush of a second night of Yom Tov is an interesting question all year round.\n\nI remember hearing what I thought then was an interesting approach, which explained why others don't follow this pattern, but I don't remember what that was, unfortunately, and I was thinking about it this year wondering if I should follow that or what my Mahzor said (it was the first year it was applicable to me making Kiddush on the first night of Sukkoth). I should have looked this up before Yom Tov. :(\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Sukkah Construction Workshop: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Scene**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Theme:** A bustling *Sukkah Construction Workshop* in the days leading up to the Jewish festival of Sukkot. The workshop is a hive of activity where craftsmen, volunteers, and inspectors collaborate to build, decorate, and certify kosher sukkahs for the community.  \n\n**Core Concept:** The environment is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy lifting** (large wooden beams, bamboo mats).  \n- **Precision tasks** (measuring, aligning, verifying kosher standards).  \n- **Distributed knowledge** (some workers know halachic requirements, others specialize in carpentry or decoration).  \n- **Time pressure** (festival approaching, orders piling up).  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe workshop is divided into five interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Lumber & Material Storage** – A covered outdoor area stacked with raw materials.  \n2. **Assembly Floor** – Open workspace with partially constructed sukkahs at various stages.  \n3. **Decoration Station** – Tables laden with fabrics, paints, and hanging ornaments.  \n4. **Rabbinic Inspection Corner** – A small desk with reference books, measuring tools, and a checklist for kosher certification.  \n5. **Tool & Supply Shed** – A cluttered storage room for smaller implements.  \n\n#### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n---  \n### **A. Lumber & Material Storage**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **weather-beaten wooden rack** (3m tall, reinforced with steel brackets) holding **untreated pine beams** (2m long, 10cm thick).  \n- A **stacked pallet of bamboo mats** (each 1.5m x 1.5m, bound with twine).  \n- A **wheeled metal cart** (rusted, one squeaky wheel) loaded with **bundles of willow branches** (for *schach*).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **half-unrolled bamboo mat** (partially torn at one edge, marked with chalk: \"REPAIR BEFORE USE\").  \n- A **misplaced bundle of cedar slats** (too narrow for structural use, tagged: \"FOR DECOR ONLY\").  \n- A **digital moisture meter** (left on a beam, battery low, last reading: 12% – borderline for kosher *schach*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **heavy-duty stapler** (jammed, missing staples).  \n- A **clipboard with inventory sheets** (last updated two days ago, coffee stain obscuring some entries).  \n- A **pair of work gloves** (left-handed one missing).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **faded \"Safety First\" poster** (peeling at edges).  \n- A **chipped mug** (holding loose nails).  \n- A **dusty stepladder** (one rung slightly cracked).  \n\n---  \n### **B. Assembly Floor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **half-built sukkah frame** (uneven, one corner 5cm higher than the others).  \n- A **workbench with clamps and vices** (scratched surface, sawdust in crevices).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **misaligned wall panel** (warped, requires two people to reposition).  \n- A **tape measure** (stuck at 1.2m, needs manual retraction).  \n- A **box of kosher certification tags** (one missing, last one reads: \"PENDING REVIEW\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **cordless drill** (battery depleted, charger nearby).  \n- A **kneeling pad** (worn foam, slightly torn).  \n- A **whiteboard** (scribbled: \"Need 4 more beams for Order #42\").  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **forgotten lunchbox** (unopened, labeled \"Shimon\").  \n- A **cracked picture frame** (showing a diagram of ideal sukkah dimensions).  \n- A **pile of wood shavings** (some stuck to the floor with dried glue).  \n\n---  \n### **C. Decoration Station**  \n*(Additional areas follow the same format, detailing objects like paintbrushes with dried colors, tangled strings of paper chains, a half-painted \"Shalom Aleichem\" sign, etc.)*  \n\n---  \n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Pine Beam (150kg, 3m long)** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Bamboo Mat Roll (awkward shape, 2m wide)** – Needs coordinated handling to avoid tears.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **paint cans**, only one has a **peeling \"Non-Toxic, Child-Safe\" label** (required for family orders).  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** A **locked toolbox** (key hidden under the Rabbinic Inspection Corner’s desk) contains the only **halachic-approved measuring tape** (needed to verify sukkah dimensions).  \n\n#### **Purposeful Noise & Distractors:**  \n- A **decorative blue glass bottle** near chemical supplies could be confused for a reagent.  \n- A **stack of outdated order forms** must be sifted through to find the latest requests.  \n\n---  \n**Result:** A dense, dynamic, and highly interactive workspace where agents must communicate, delegate, and problem-solve under realistic constraints."
