(Which, everybody keeps carefully reminding us, was filmed before she did Hunger Games.) Lawrence and her mom (Elizabeth Shue) move in near a house where a double murder happened, and there's a creepy dude there, and the basement is full of scary, and there are hints that something supernatural might be going on. Might.\n\nBut what's with all the time going backwards in the trailer? Is this something that happens in the movie, or are the film-makers just getting arty? And why is Jennifer Lawrence's makeup so 1970s-debutante looking? I'm way more pumped for a horror movie about a monster whose power is time-reversal than I am about another \"house where something scary happened in the past, and it's still scary for some reason\" movie.

  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Temporal Anomaly Research Facility**  \n\n## **1. Overall Theme and Core Concept**  \nA clandestine **Temporal Anomaly Research Facility**, hidden beneath an unassuming suburban home, where scientists and engineers study a localized time-reversal phenomenon. The facility is a high-stakes environment where equipment malfunctions unpredictably, documents rewrite themselves, and objects phase in and out of temporal sync.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment:** Some devices are too large or delicate for one person to move.  \n- **Safety Protocols:** Certain tasks require synchronized actions (e.g., two people holding down a lever while a third presses a button).  \n- **Time-Sensitive Coordination:** Agents must operate in sync to counteract the facility’s temporal instability.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility consists of:  \n1. **Surface House (Decoy):** A dilapidated two-story home with peeling wallpaper, broken floorboards, and a conspicuous cellar door.  \n2. **Primary Research Lab:** A reinforced underground chamber with flickering overhead lights, humming servers, and a massive **Temporal Stabilization Core (TSC)** at its center.  \n3. **Observation Deck:** A glass-walled mezzanine overlooking the TSC, filled with monitors and sensor readouts.  \n4. **Storage & Supply Room:** Cluttered with crates of spare parts, hazardous materials, and archived research logs.  \n5. **Living Quarters:** A cramped bunk area for researchers, strewn with personal effects and hastily scribbled notes.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Surface House (Decoy)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **rickety wooden staircase** leading to the second floor, missing several steps.  \n- A **dust-covered dining table** with three mismatched chairs, one of which has a broken leg.  \n- A **rusty metal cellar door**, padlocked from the inside.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **disassembled rotary phone** on the table, wires exposed—possibly rigged as an alarm.  \n- A **faded newspaper clipping** pinned to the wall, detailing a decades-old missing persons case.  \n- A **broken pocket watch** on the mantelpiece, its hands spinning erratically backward.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **functioning but flickering ceiling light**, casting uneven shadows.  \n- A **wooden toolbox** under the table, containing rusted nails and a bent screwdriver.  \n- A **partially melted candle** on a windowsill, wax frozen mid-drip.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **moth-eaten armchair** with suspicious dark stains.  \n- A **stack of yellowed National Geographic magazines** from the 1970s.  \n- A **dusty mirror** reflecting the room—but sometimes showing a different angle.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Primary Research Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- The **Temporal Stabilization Core (TSC)**, a massive cylindrical device with glowing conduits, suspended from the ceiling.  \n- A **steel workbench** bolted to the floor, covered in schematics and tools.  \n- A **reinforced glass containment chamber** with visible temporal distortions inside.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **dislodged power coupling** from the TSC—requires two people to realign while a third stabilizes the core.  \n- A **shattered vial of chrono-reactive fluid**, slowly reassembling itself on the floor.  \n- A **partially erased whiteboard**, equations fading in and out of existence.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **bank of humming servers**, some displaying corrupted data.  \n- A **hydraulic lift table** for adjusting the TSC’s alignment.  \n- A **wall-mounted fire extinguisher**, labeled \"For Temporal Fires Only.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **coffee mug with a half-drunk beverage**, steam rising in reverse.  \n- A **safety poster** warning about \"Unstable Time Loops.\"  \n- A **sticky note** on a monitor: \"DO NOT TOUCH—LAST TIME IT ERASED ME FOR 3 HOURS.\"  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Observation Deck**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **wraparound control panel** with flickering CRT monitors.  \n- A **reinforced glass window**, partially fogged with condensation.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **faulty lever switch**—requires one agent to hold it while another recalibrates the system.  \n- A **glitching security camera feed**, showing delayed or reversed footage.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **rolling office chair** with a broken wheel.  \n- A **half-empty water cooler**, the liquid inside occasionally defying gravity.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **wall calendar** where dates keep shifting.  \n- A **scientist’s lab coat** hanging on a hook, sometimes appearing inside-out.  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The TSC Power Coupling (150kg, 2m long)** requires two agents to lift while a third aligns it.  \n- **The Hydraulic Lift Table (300kg, 3m wide)** needs synchronized weight distribution to avoid tilting.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five identical-looking vials**, only one has a **blue cap, handwritten \"Corrosive,\" and is half-full**—but nearby decorative blue flasks add confusion.  \n- **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning:** The **padlocked cellar door** requires a **key hidden inside a hollowed-out book in the living quarters**.  \n\n### **Dynamic Problem States:**  \n- **The TSC periodically destabilizes**, forcing agents to recalibrate it before a localized time loop forms.  \n- **Documents rewrite themselves**, requiring quick verification of information before it changes.  \n\n---  \n\nThis **hyper-detailed, temporally unstable research facility** is primed for **complex multi-agent collaboration**, combining **physical coordination, reasoning under uncertainty, and time-sensitive problem-solving**."
