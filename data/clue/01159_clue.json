They have had a week's induction in July so I think they are pretty much straight into 'normal school'. I think he should take it just in case, DH is convinced they won't need it. School not answering the phone...\n\nhaggisaggis Mon 02-Sep-13 15:35:15\n\nDid he not get a timetable during his induction? If he's timetabled for it, he will get it.\n\nnoblegiraffe Mon 02-Sep-13 15:37:41\n\nIf he had a week's induction does he already have his timetable?\n\nChances are he won't have PE and if he does have PE so many others won't have their kit that they won't do a practical.\n\nBackforGood Mon 02-Sep-13 15:38:16\n\nProbably not that likely - but that said, none of mine had a week's induction, so possibly more likely for your ds than my dd grin\n\nEither way, my dd will be taking hers, as I think it's better to have it and not need it, than not have it if they do need it.\n\norangeandemons Mon 02-Sep-13 15:39:02\n\nAm amazed at all these kids who got their timetable during induction. The staff in our school only got them on the last week of term\n\nNoComet Mon 02-Sep-13 15:41:41\n\nAlmost certainly not DDs never do, they do planning and talking about things if there is PE first day back.\n\nTiggles Mon 02-Sep-13 15:44:14\n\nNo, he didn't get a timetable, they just had lots of lessons and maths tests etc. All the other forms did PE in the induction week except his.\n\nPareyMortas Mon 02-Sep-13 15:46:19\n\nDd1 had PE on her first day in year seven, it was timetabled for the afternoon.\n\nhaggisaggis Mon 02-Sep-13 15:55:45\n\nI know at ds's school that they go on to the new timetable at the end of June before school finishes for the summer - and I remember he already had his timetable before he started S1. But maybe it's different up here.\n\nutterlyashamedofmyself Mon 02-Sep-13 16:01:27\n\nI did PE on my first day of Senior school , I also didn't take my kit & ended up in detention not bitter at all\n\ncricketballs Mon 02-Sep-13 16:10:41\n\nat my place, normal lessons happen in the afternoon of the first day; timetables are only given out in the morning (as staff we are lucky if we get them in the last week of July). If he has pe in the afternoon I very much doubt it will be expected that he will have kit. The first PE lessons for all year 7 is not a practical lesson anyway as they have to go through rules, procedures, reminding them where everything is etc and then an information gathering exercise as in who prefers what sports, who does what outside of school etc\n\nTiggles Mon 02-Sep-13 16:24:02\n\ngrin after reading utterly's horror story I think I'll send him in with kit just to be on the safe side. He has autism, and if he gets something like that 'wrong' I may struggle to ever get him to go again.\n\nAnthracite Mon 02-Sep-13 17:44:51\n\nI imagine the PE teachers work each day of the week, so there is a chance he will have PE and will need his kit.\n\nThis reminds me that I still need to label DD's kit.\n\ncreamteas Mon 02-Sep-13 18:54:26\n\nAt my DCs school, normal lessons after morning break and detentions on day one in no PE kit sad\n\nDoes he have access to a locker? If so it is no hardship to take it in on day one and just leave it there till the first PE lesson anyway\n\nSaffyz Mon 02-Sep-13 18:59:45\n\nMight as well take it in case.\n\nAChickenCalledKorma Mon 02-Sep-13 19:06:06\n\nMine is taking hers. They should get their locker keys on the first day, so if she doesn't use it she can shove it in her locker and I won't have to think about it any more.\n\nHulababy Mon 02-Sep-13 19:09:02\n\nDD hasn't had a timetable yet. She will take her PE bag in on the first day and it will then reside in her sport's locker.\n\nmumslife Mon 02-Sep-13 21:27:00\n\nSon taken his for his own peace of mind really i know from my dd they dont do pe on the first pe lesson but can put it in his locker then its there when needed\n\nTiggles Mon 02-Sep-13 22:48:23\n\nThanks all. It's in his bag. As far as I can tell they don't have lockers though.\n\ncls77 Tue 03-Sep-13 14:19:58\n\nMy dd started year 7 today and has to collect her pe kit at the school today?! Not sure when they expect us to label it hmm\n\nepic78 Thu 05-Sep-13 00:41:10\n\nNow I am worried. Dd starts middle school tomorrow and I haven't even labelled pe kit. Also no locker until we pay a deposit /fee.\nOnly hald day induction and no timetable.\n\nMadeOfStarDust Thu 05-Sep-13 09:38:59\n\nOurs were told no-one needs PE kit first day back after summer. They get their timetables on day1 and have enough to think about.\n\nMaltamum Fri 11-Oct-13 21:58:39\n\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nJoin the discussion\n\n\nRegister now\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** Secondary School Locker Room & PE Storage Facility  \n**Core Concept:** A bustling secondary school sports complex where students transition between academic and physical activities. The scene is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Shared Resources:** Limited locker space, communal equipment, and time pressure between classes.  \n- **Physical Constraints:** Heavy/bulky sports gear requiring teamwork to transport.  \n- **Organizational Challenges:** Misplaced/lost items, unlabeled kits, and procedural confusion (e.g., new students unfamiliar with layout).  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Locker Room**:  \n   - Purpose: Central hub for storing personal PE kits and changing.  \n   - Features: Rows of metal lockers (some dented, others pristine), wooden benches, flickering fluorescent lights, and a faint smell of sweat mixed with disinfectant.  \n   - Key Challenge: Overcrowding during peak times; lockers are too narrow for bulky sports bags.  \n\n2. **Equipment Storage Closet**:  \n   - Purpose: Houses shared sports gear (balls, nets, cones).  \n   - Features: Crowded with overflowing bins, a broken wheel on one cart, and a handwritten sign: \"RETURN ALL ITEMS BY 3 PM.\"  \n\n3. **Lost & Found Corner**:  \n   - Purpose: Graveyard of unclaimed items.  \n   - Features: A sagging cardboard box labeled \"UNLABELED KITS,\" a single mud-crusted cleat, and a pile of mismatched socks.  \n\n4. **Teacher’s Office (Adjacent)**:  \n   - Purpose: PE staff manage schedules and disciplinary issues.  \n   - Features: A cluttered desk with a half-filled detention log, a whiteboard listing \"First-Day Rules,\" and a steaming mug of tea atop a stack of unopened timetables.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Locker Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Lockers:** 50cm-wide steel lockers (10 are broken/dented; 3 have sticky combination dials).  \n- **Central Bench:** Scuffed pine, 2.5m long, with \"Y7 SUCKS\" carved into one end.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **PE Kits:**  \n  - *DS’s Kit*: Blue duffel bag (weight: 5kg), inside: size-12 trainers (clean), crumpled polo shirt (missing a button), socks (unpaired).  \n  - *Labeled Kit*: Neatly packed with \"H. AGGIS\" in Sharpie on every item.  \n- **Locker #12:** Jammed shut; requires two agents to force open (collaboration needed).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Wall Clock:** Stopped at 11:47 (real time is 1:15 PM).  \n- **Broken Locker Alarm:** Emits intermittent beeps (requires resetting via hidden panel).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti:** \"Mr. Smith is a TYRANT\" scribbled behind a locker door.  \n- **Abandoned Items:** A single glitter hairclip, a half-eaten granola bar.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Equipment Storage Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Metal Shelving Unit:** Overloaded with deflated basketballs (state: 3 punctured).  \n- **Equipment Cart:** One wheel detached; requires lifting to move (weight: 80kg).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **First-Day Sign-Up Sheet:** Torn corner; names are illegible.  \n- **Volleyball Net:** Tangled in a heap (requires untangling before use).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Dirty Mop Bucket:** Blocking the door; sloshing gray water.  \n- **Leaky Pipe:** Drips onto a stack of spare jerseys (state: damp).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated Posters:** \"2012 Regional Champions!\" (faded).  \n- **Dusty Trophy:** Engraved \"Best Effort 2009.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Equipment Cart:** Requires 2+ agents to lift (80kg, 1.5m long).  \n- **Jammed Locker #12:** Needs simultaneous force applied at top/bottom.  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - *Task:* \"Find DS’s unlabeled kit among 20 identical blue bags.\"  \n  - *Clues:* Unique buttonless polo, one sock with a hole.  \n  - *Noise:* Decoy bags with similar wear (e.g., a kit missing both socks).  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - *Problem:* Tangled volleyball net.  \n  - *Solution:* Retrieve scissors from Teacher’s Office (locked drawer; key under mug).  \n\n**Atmospheric \"Noise\":**  \n- The stopped clock forces agents to ask for time (social interaction).  \n- Flickering lights distract from locating small items (e.g., lost keys).  \n\n---  \n**Final Note:** This environment thrives on *emergent chaos*—students rushing, misplaced items, and procedural ambiguity create endless collaborative problem-solving opportunities."
