TechCrunch reports AA is pushing its Gogo streaming video service to all 767s, offering 100 films and episodes.\n\nA TV show will cost you a buck a pop, and movies will run at four each—pretty standard. Each piece of video pie will beam straight to your laptop (and later tablet) via WiFi, so you don't have to bother with those minuscule displays mounted to the back of each seat that's always smeared with gross finger grease anyway. Best of all, you won't have to pony up for in-flight internet access to get the goods. [TechCrunch]\n",
  "response": "### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Scene Type:** *In-Flight Media Server Upgrade Bay* – A specialized maintenance and upgrade facility for commercial aircraft entertainment systems, located within a bustling airline hangar.  \n\n**Core Concept:** A high-pressure environment where a team of technicians, engineers, and logistics personnel must collaborate to retrofit an aging fleet of Boeing 767s with next-gen wireless streaming entertainment systems before a tight regulatory deadline.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment Handling:** Servers, wiring bundles, and aircraft panels are too bulky or unwieldy for one person.  \n- **Specialized Roles:** Engineers troubleshoot software, electricians rewire cabin systems, and logistics coordinators track parts.  \n- **Time Pressure:** Misplaced tools, incorrect configurations, or conflicting instructions can cause costly delays.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\nThe scene is a partitioned section of a larger airline maintenance hangar, divided into four key areas:  \n\n1. **Aircraft Work Bay (Primary Workspace):**  \n   - An elevated platform surrounds a parked 767 with open access panels along the cabin ceiling.  \n   - Overhead gantries hold cables and tools. Fluorescent work lights cast sharp shadows.  \n\n2. **Server Installation Station:**  \n   - A wheeled cart with the new **Gogo Streaming Media Server** (dimensions: 80x60x40cm, weight: 55kg) and racks of **WiFi repeaters** (each 30x20x10cm, in anti-static bags).  \n   - A **diagnostic terminal** displays signal strength maps of the cabin.  \n\n3. **Parts & Tools Prep Area:**  \n   - Shelves of labeled **cable harnesses**, **fiber-optic spools**, and **replacement seatback LCDs** (smudged with synthetic \"finger grease\" for realism).  \n   - A **locked toolbox** (combo: 23-17-05) contains specialized **aviation-grade crimpers**.  \n\n4. **Logistics & Documentation Hub:**  \n   - A cluttered desk with **flight manifests**, **FAA compliance checklists**, and a **thermal printer** spooling out fresh work orders.  \n   - A **whiteboard** lists aircraft tail numbers and statuses (e.g., *\"N345AA: CABIN WIRING 80% DONE – NEED FINAL SIGN-OFF\"*).  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Aircraft Work Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Open Overhead Panel:** Reveals a maze of existing **coaxial cables** (tagged with faded maintenance dates) and the **old seatback video control box** (sticker: *\"OUT OF SERVICE – DO NOT POWER\"*).  \n- **Hydraulic Work Platform:** Adjustable height, currently raised to 3m, with **non-slip grating** and a **safety harness clip-point**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **New WiFi Antenna Array:** Six **dual-band transceivers** (each 15cm long, with magnetic mounts) must be spaced evenly along the cabin.  \n- **Obstruction:** A **kinked fiber-optic line** (red **\"FAILED TEST\"** tag) blocks access to the primary server port.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Portable Air Compressor:** Hissing softly, powering a **pneumatic cable cutter** on a hook.  \n- **Clipboard with Wiring Diagrams:** One corner coffee-stained, pages stuck together.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti:** A tiny **doodle of a frowning airplane** in Sharpie near the access panel.  \n- **Discarded Gloves:** Nitrile gloves (size L) crumpled near a drain grate.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Server Installation Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Anti-Static Mat:** Unrolled beneath the **Gogo server**, which has **four blinking status LEDs** (green, amber, red, blue).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Master Configuration Tablet:** Displaying **\"ERROR: CABIN ZONE 4 SIGNAL WEAK\"**.  \n- **Calibration Device:** A **signal analyzer** with a frayed USB cable.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Spare Power Supplies:** Stacked in a **bin labeled \"TESTED – 12V ONLY\"**.  \n- **USB Drive:** Taped to the cart with **\"DRIVERS v3.2 BACKUP\"** scrawled on it.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee Ring Stain:** On the cart surface, overlapping a **partially peeled \"I ❤️ IT\" sticker**.  \n- **Dead Plant:** A shriveled succulent in a **AA-branded mug**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- The **Gogo server (55kg)** requires two people to lift safely onto the hydraulic platform. One must stabilize the **wheels of the cart (locked)** while the other guides it.  \n- The **overhead coaxial bundle (4m long, 30kg)** must be held in place while a technician reroutes it.  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **WiFi repeaters**, only one has a **blue calibration sticker** (others: red/yellow). However, a **blue stress ball** on the logistics desk adds perceptual noise.  \n- **Compound Problem-Solving:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **diagnostic terminal** shows **\"ZONE 4 OFFLINE\"** due to a **disconnected antenna (magnetic mount detached)**.  \n  - **Solution:** The **replacement antenna** is in a **parts bin under the workbench**, but the bin is **jammed (requires two agents: one to pry, one to pull)**.  \n\n**Atmospheric \"Noise\":**  \n- A **radio chatter** from adjacent hangars plays snippets like *\"Tower, confirm fuel load...\"*  \n- A **flickering LED strip** in the ceiling adds urgency—does it indicate a power issue, or is it just old wiring?  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** The scene is *dense* with intentional problems—misplaced tools, ambiguous labels, and physical constraints that *require* coordination, communication, and reasoning to overcome. Every object serves either as a puzzle piece, a distractor, or atmospheric texture."
