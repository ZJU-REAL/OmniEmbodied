Baker  |  Posted 2004-09-26 Email Print this article Print\n\nThe U.S. National Academies of Science concluded that bans on access are more likely to keep scientists away from their lab benches than to keep terrorists away from their schemes.\n\nThe lead editorial in a leading medical journal called for genomic data on pathogens to remain widely available, saying the benefits of promoting medical research far outweigh the risks of helping bioterrorists. It lauded the same conclusion by a panel of the U.S. National Academies of Science and Engineering. To read a summary of the panels decision, click here. On the same day the Lancet article appeared, researchers from Columbia University published the sequence for the bacteria causing Legionairres disease in Science, another highly esteemed journal, and in GenBank, a public database. Making the sequences available was one of the conditions of his National Institutes of Health funding, but corresponding author James Russo said he was very happy to do so.\nI asked how one should weigh the risks and benefits of providing such data. He acknowledged that it was a tough question. \"Id like to think for every person with such sinister motives, there are many many scientists with an interest in using the information for health or other benefits, and with an interest in developing biological, medical and other ways to overcome potential threats,\" Russo said.\nFor example, the sequence had already found genes that might explain how the bacteria could move through biofilms and tissues, and could be targets for future drug discovery. Other genes code for surface proteins on the bacteria and could inspire vaccines. The high number of genes that seem to code for proteins to shunt heavy metals outside the bacteria could explain why the potentially lethal pathogen could actually live inside human white blood cells. Figuring out exactly what the genes do and how that knowledge might be used to develop therapies was out of his ken, Russo said. Thats precisely why he wants to share the data. The scientists who do study how bacteria invade tissues, evade the immune system and otherwise wreak havoc often use sequence data to track down genes involved in those processes. Indeed, said Russo, as the collection of sequenced bacterial genomes grow, researchers are finding many more unique genes than expected. These genes are potentially launching pads for work toward new antibiotics or engineering useful bacteria. Some might argue that genes are also launching pads for terror attacks, but Russo said that was unlikely without a vast research infrastructure. \"Its a long way from sequencing an organism to understanding how it works, so I dont think simply providing a sequence will be a big help to bioterrorists,\" he said.\nComparing the genome of one bacteria with another has already yielded some useful surprises. The Legionella bacterium has a much more dangerous and infectious cousin, Coxiella burnetti, which causes Q fever. Having both sequences has pointed to some genetic explanations of their differences and similarities, said Russo, so some studies of Coxiella burnetti could likely be done using the less dangerous Legionella. In other words, access to genomic data increases, rather than decreases, safety. There is some risk in making these sequences available, yes. To consider these risks, the National Science Foundation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Institutes of Health and other groups sought advice from the National Research Council, the working arm of the National Academies of Science and Engineering. The National Academies is an independent organization, established by Congress to give scientific advice. Its panel concluded that bans on access are more likely to keep scientists away from their lab benches than to keep terrorists away from their schemes. \"Open access is essential if we are to maintain the progress needed to stay ahead of those who would attempt to cause harm,\" said Stanley Falkow, chair of the committee that wrote the report, and professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University in Stanford, Calif. Such reasoning seems a welcome respite to the partisan science seen lately from government agencies. M.L. Baker writes about health and biotechnology IT for eWEEK.com.

  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *High-Security Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) Research Laboratory*  \n**Core Concept:** A cutting-edge pathogen research lab where genomic sequencing, bioweapon defense studies, and collaborative containment protocols intersect. The lab is designed for simultaneous multi-agent tasks—handling hazardous samples, calibrating sensitive equipment, and maintaining strict biosecurity.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Complex Equipment:** Many instruments (e.g., sequencers, centrifuges) require two agents to operate safely.  \n- **Dual-Verification Systems:** Biocontainment doors, sample locks, and data terminals mandate synchronized actions.  \n- **Emergency Protocols:** Spill containment or decontamination demands coordinated responses.  \n\n---  \n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Lab (Primary Workspace)**  \n   - *Purpose:* Genomic sequencing, live pathogen analysis.  \n   - *Atmosphere:* Sterile but cluttered; humming servers, UV decon lights, and the faint ozone tang of active electronics.  \n   - *Key Features:* Reinforced glass partitions, floor-marked hazard zones, ceiling-mounted emergency showers.  \n\n2. **Sample Preparation Room (Adjacent, Air-Locked)**  \n   - *Purpose:* Decanting/diluting hazardous fluids.  \n   - *Atmosphere:* Negative-pressure ventilation hisses faintly; walls lined with biohazard symbol decals.  \n   - *Key Features:* Glovebox workstations, retinal-scanner-locked fridge.  \n\n3. **Data Server Closet (Rear, Restricted Access)**  \n   - *Purpose:* Stores genomic databases and surveillance footage.  \n   - *Atmosphere:* Cold from AC units; flickering drive arrays.  \n   - *Key Features:* Keypad-locked door, physical backup tapes in fireproof safes.  \n\n4. **Decontamination Airlock (Entry/Exit)**  \n   - *Purpose:* Personnel/cargo sterilization.  \n   - *Atmosphere:* Chemical-smelling; UV-lit with floor drains.  \n   - *Key Features:* Boot scrubbers, full-body sensor arrays.  \n\n5. **Break Room (Overlooked but Critical)**  \n   - *Purpose:* Mundane yet vital for \"noise\" realism.  \n   - *Atmosphere:* Stale coffee, pinned-up memos about lab safety quizzes.  \n   - *Key Features:* Fridge with expired lunches, a broken microwave beeping intermittently.  \n\n---  \n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- *Next-Gen Sequencer (Model X-9000):* 2m tall, 300kg, touchscreen with a cracked corner. Requires two agents to lift/reposition.  \n- *Biosafety Cabinet (Class II):* 1.5m wide, HEPA-filtered, interior smeared with dried agar residue.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- *Legionella Sample Tray:* 4x6 grid of vials; one vial (B7) has a cracked cap leaking pink fluid.  \n- *Electron Microscope:* Requires alignment calibration (knob stuck at \"15kV\").  \n- *Biometric Terminal:* Scans fingerprints but intermittently displays \"ERROR: COOLANT LOW.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- *Centrifuge:* Spinning at 10,000 RPM (lid unlocked; will trigger alarm if opened mid-cycle).  \n- *Autoclave:* Display reads \"121°C – 15 MIN REMAINING.\"  \n- *Hazardous Waste Bin:* 3/4 full of shattered glassware.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- *Whiteboard:* Scribbled with half-erased DNA sequences and a doodle of a frowning bacterium.  \n- *\"DAYS SINCE INCIDENT\" Counter:* Stuck at \"0\" with fresh marker.  \n- *Framed Safety Poster:* \"REPORT UNSECURED SAMPLES\" (peeling at corners).  \n\n---  \n#### **2. Sample Prep Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- *Glovebox Workstation:* Left glove has a 2cm tear; right glove is pristine.  \n- *-80°C Freezer:* Humming loudly; keypad reads \"DEFROST CYCLE ACTIVE.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- *Coxiella burnetii Isolate:* In a stainless-steel canister labeled \"Q-FEVER – DO NOT THAW.\"  \n- *Pipette Set:* One pipette (10μL) is misaligned, dispensing 12μL inaccurately.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- *Bunsen Burner:* Flame stuck at max height; gas valve squeaks when turned.  \n- *Lab Coat Rack:* One coat sleeve is contaminated with fluorescent dye stains.  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- *Coffee-Stained Notebook:* Open to a page titled \"Gene 447b – Immune Evasion?\"  \n- *Decorative Periodic Table:* With \"WARNING: BIOHAZARD\" sticky note on arsenic.  \n\n---  \n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- *Sequencer X-9000 (300kg, 2m tall):* Requires two agents to lift onto a wheeled cart (note: cart’s left wheel squeaks).  \n- *Coxiella Canister (50kg, -80°C):* Must be moved via a dual-handled transport pod to prevent thawing.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - *Task:* \"Find the leaking Legionella vial.\"  \n  - *Clues:* Vial B7 is the only one with a *pink fluid leak* + *cracked cap* + *handwritten \"Lp02\" label*.  \n  - *Noise:* 5 other vials have blue caps (non-leaking) and a decorative pink sticker on the rack.  \n\n- **Compound Tool-Use:**  \n  - *Problem:* Biometric terminal has a \"COOLANT LOW\" error.  \n  - *Solution:* Coolant is in the prep room fridge (behind retinal scan), but the scanner only works if the nearby Bunsen burner is turned off (heat interference).  \n\n---  \n**Final Atmosphere Notes:**  \n- *Sound:* Distant beeping from a neglected freezer alarm in the hallway.  \n- *Smell:* Antiseptic with undertones of burnt coffee from the break room.  \n- *Light:* Flickering LED above the sequencer casts intermittent shadows.  \n\nThis environment is *dense* with collaborative triggers—whether moving heavy equipment, diagnosing equipment failures, or resolving biohazard leaks under time pressure. The clutter of mundane items (e.g., coffee cups, outdated posters) forces agents to filter signal from noise, just like real-world labs."
