  "response": "### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Avian Research & Rehabilitation Center*  \n**Core Concept:** A bustling facility dedicated to the study, care, and rehabilitation of rare and endangered bird species, inspired by the diverse avian Pokémon mentioned in the forum thread. The center is a hub for scientists, veterinarians, and volunteers, requiring constant multi-agent collaboration due to the delicate, heavy, or hazardous nature of avian care.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Large-Scale Care:** Birds range from small (Doduo) to massive (Ho-Oh, Articuno), necessitating team efforts for transport and handling.  \n- **Specialized Tasks:** Some birds require synchronized feeding (e.g., corrosive chemicals in Honchkrow’s diet), while others need environmental monitoring (e.g., Yveltal’s dark-energy containment).  \n- **Emergency Protocols:** \"In case of emergency, start screaming\" hints at alarm systems, distressed animals, and rapid response teams.  \n\n---  \n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility is a modular, high-tech yet slightly worn-down complex with:  \n1. **Main Aviary Dome** – A towering glass structure housing large birds (Staraptor, Braviary). Perches are reinforced steel, some slightly bent from use.  \n2. **Isolation Labs** – For volatile species (Yveltal, Honchkrow). Negative-pressure airlocks, warning lights.  \n3. **Nursery & Rehabilitation Wing** – Incubators for eggs, small recovery cages (Pidgeotto, Doduo).  \n4. **Supply & Storage Bay** – Crowded with crates of feed, medical kits, and cleaning supplies.  \n5. **Observation Deck** – Overlooks the aviary; cluttered with binoculars, spilled coffee, and scribbled notes.  \n6. **Staff Break Room** – Functional but messy. A faded \"Safety First!\" poster hangs crookedly.  \n\n---  \n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Area 1: Main Aviary Dome**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Steel Perch Arrays** (3m tall, 200kg each, welded to floor). One perch has a cracked base.  \n- **Automated Feeding Cranes** (5m reach, jammed in \"halt\" position; control panel blinking \"ERROR 47\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Staraptor Restraint Harness** (leather straps, 15kg, labeled \"FOR AGGRESSIVE SUBJECTS\").  \n- **Broken Thermal Lamp** (glass shards on floor; replacement bulb in Storage Bay).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Feeding Trays** (stained with berry juice; one tray tipped over).  \n- **Water Dispenser** (leaking, puddle forming near electrical outlet).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Photos** (faded shots of \"Staff Bird of the Month: Pidgeot, 2012\").  \n- **Dusty Feather Collection** (in shadowbox; label reads \"Articuno Molt Samples – DO NOT TOUCH\").  \n\n---  \n#### **Area 2: Isolation Labs**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Yveltal Containment Unit** (2m titanium cylinder, humming with red \"ACTIVE\" light).  \n- **Emergency Shower Station** (rusted pull-chain, \"LAST INSPECTED 2018\" sticker).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Corrosive Diet Bottle** (blue cap, handwritten \"FOR HONCHKROW ONLY – 50mL MAX\").  \n- **Airlock Keypad** (sticky note: \"CODE 0717 – DON’T LET IT OUT\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Biohazard Bin** (overflowing with blackened gloves).  \n- **Decontamination Sprayer** (empty, nozzle clogged).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti** (carved into wall: \"NIGHT SHIFT WAS HERE\").  \n- **Dead Plant** (in cracked pot; sign: \"DO NOT WATER – HYDRATION SENSOR\").  \n\n---  \n#### **Area 3: Nursery Wing**  \n*(Example of attribute-based reasoning: Among five incubators, only one has a functioning humidity gauge (green light) and a handwritten note: \"Doduo – TURN EVERY 2 HRS.\" Others have dead batteries or missing labels.)*  \n\n---  \n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Yveltal Containment Unit (150kg, 2m tall)** – Requires two agents to wheel it for maintenance; one must steady the base while the other disconnects power cables.  \n- **Crate of Live Crickets (20kg, marked \"URGENT – FEED STARAPTOR\")** – Too heavy/unwieldy for one agent; lid is loosely nailed shut (risk of escape).  \n\n**Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Problem:** The broken thermal lamp in the aviary needs replacement.  \n  - **Solution:** Agents must:  \n    1. Locate the correct bulb (in Storage Bay, labeled \"AVIARY LAMP – 500W\").  \n    2. Use insulated gloves (hanging near electrical panel) to handle it.  \n    3. Coordinate to avoid startling birds during installation.  \n- **Distractor:** A decorative blue glass orb on a shelf mimics the bulb’s shape, requiring careful inspection.  \n\n**Compound Reasoning:**  \n- **Locked Medical Cabinet** (holds antidotes for poisoned birds).  \n  - **Key:** Hidden inside a staffer’s abandoned backpack (in Break Room, under a moldy sandwich).  \n\n---  \n**Final Atmosphere Notes:**  \n- **Sounds:** Distant bird calls, intermittent alarm beeps, hissing pipes.  \n- **Smells:** Antiseptic, wet feathers, burnt wiring.  \n- **Lights:** Flickering fluorescents in Storage Bay; eerie red glow in Isolation.  \n\nThis environment thrives on *chaotic realism*—every object has weight, history, and stakes, forcing agents to navigate physical and cognitive challenges amid distracting, lived-in clutter."
