Click to Upload a photo (10 MB limit)\n  1. Nice review. One thing you missed out on is their Chinese Chicken Salad. New Moon makes THE BEST. Word is that they are the ones who invented this (although some dispute it) but whatever, it is not like the stuff you find at most places with the sticky, syrupy, overly sweet dressing flooding everything. If you should go back, make it a point to try this dish. For some reason it is also very reasonably priced compared to their other dishes.\n\n    1. Two words: Chloe's Shrimp\n\n      (OK, plus a Tsingtao or three.)\n\n      1. Huh... you've piqued my curiosity.\n\n        Let me know if you're planning to go eggroll tasting at Genghis Cohen... I live down the street and around the corner. Would be curious to know how you'd compare the two.\n\n        Mr Taster\n\n        1. We had a 7pm reservation but came in at 6 hoping to get an early start - we were seated immediately. Calimari appetizer was fantastic, Wor Won Ton soup was great, Chloe Shrimp was good, but not great. Mongolian beef was good but bland. It should always be served on a sizzling platter - litigious state maybe? Service was absolutely perfect - very attentative without being intrusive, thank you Jonathan! Fabulous welcoming atmosphere, great wine/beer list. Perfect place to go with friends. Highly reccomend the appetizer menu. Large portions. It is great to have such a place here in Montrose. My prejudice is that I am half Chinese and my grandmother was a gourmet Chinese cook and I didn't expect gourmet chinese food. This place didn't disappoint at all. The only down side was the food was a bit bland, which doesn't live up to the menu descriptions. However, perfect seasonings are provided to taste - I would rather have bland and be able to add seasoning than have it over seasoned and not be able to do anything about it.\n\n          1 Reply\n          1. re: fewinhibitions\n\n            I wouldn't think it's the litigious nature of our society -- after all, fajitas are served on sizzling plates even at corporate chain outposts like El Torito and (gah) Chevy's... but then I've never had Mongolian beef on a sizzling plate, sounds like it would be good!\n\n            I agree about the seasonings, but I asked for chili oil and it appeared in ten seconds flat, so I can't fault them... I'm of your school of thinking, when it doubt underseason and provide a dish of whatever to punch it up.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"New Moon Restaurant Kitchen & Dining Area\"**  \n\n#### **Overall Theme and Core Concept**  \nThe **New Moon Restaurant** is a bustling, mid-sized Chinese-American eatery known for its signature dishes and warm, welcoming atmosphere. The scene is a **high-density, collaboration-rich environment** where kitchen staff, servers, and managers must coordinate seamlessly to handle orders, prep ingredients, and maintain service quality. The kitchen is alive with sizzling woks, steaming pots, and tightly packed stations, while the dining area is a mix of intimate booths and lively communal tables.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Large Objects:** Stock crates, industrial mixer bowls, and boiling stock pots require two people to move safely.  \n- **Time-Sensitive Coordination:** Orders must be prepped, cooked, plated, and delivered in sync.  \n- **Specialized Roles:** Chefs, servers, bussers, and hosts must communicate to avoid bottlenecks.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Kitchen (Hot Line)** – The heart of the restaurant, where woks blaze and dishes are assembled.  \n2. **Prep Area (Cold Station)** – Where vegetables are chopped, sauces mixed, and proteins marinated.  \n3. **Expediting Counter** – The bridge between kitchen and dining, where plates are checked and garnished.  \n4. **Dining Area** – A mix of booths, round tables, and a bar seating area, each with its own needs.  \n5. **Storage/Backroom** – Dry goods, refrigerators, and spare equipment.  \n6. **Dishwashing Station** – A high-traffic zone where dirty dishes pile up and clean ones are redistributed.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Kitchen (Hot Line)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Wok Station (x3)** – Gas-powered, with built-in exhaust hoods. One has a flickering flame regulator.  \n- **Steel Prep Table (2m x 1m)** – Stained with soy sauce and scorch marks. A large cleaver is embedded in a worn wooden block.  \n- **Overhead Shelf Rack** – Holds metal strainers, ladles, and spare oil bottles.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sizzling Platter (Mongolian Beef Dish)** – Heavy cast iron, requires two hands to carry safely. Currently missing from its usual spot.  \n- **Chloe's Shrimp Prep Tray** – A half-finished batch, some shrimp deveined, others not. A sticky note reads: \"*Need more chili oil—ask Jonathan*.\"  \n- **Wor Won Ton Soup Pot (Large, 12L)** – Simmering, lid slightly askew. A wooden spoon rests against it, stained with broth.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Spice Rack** – 20+ labeled jars (star anise, Szechuan peppercorns, crushed red pepper).  \n- **Oil Dispenser (500ml, glass)** – Half-full, with a slow leak near the nozzle.  \n- **Timer (Digital, wall-mounted)** – Beeping intermittently (battery low).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Safety Poster** – \"**Grease Fire Protocol**\" with smudged instructions.  \n- **Stained Apron** – Hung on a hook, embroidered \"*Chef Li*\" in fraying thread.  \n- **Dented Aluminum Tray** – Tossed in a corner, bent from misuse.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Prep Area (Cold Station)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Stainless Steel Worktable (2.5m x 1m)** – Slightly tilted (one leg uneven).  \n- **Commercial Refrigerator (2m tall)** – Humming loudly, door slightly ajar.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Chinese Chicken Salad Mixing Bowl (Large, 8kg when full)** – Requires two people to lift safely. Currently empty.  \n- **Box of Fresh Cilantro** – Half-wilted, with a handwritten note: \"*From Farmer’s Market—use tonight*.\"  \n- **Sealed Soy Sauce Jug (5L)** – Unopened, label partially torn.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Mandoline Slicer** – Blade exposed, a small cut glove beside it.  \n- **Scale (Digital, 5kg max)** – Display flickering between grams and ounces.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Chalkboard Menu** – Partially erased, with \"*SPECIAL: Crab Rangoon*\" scrawled hastily.  \n- **Stack of Takeout Containers** – Some dented, piled haphazardly.  \n- **Dried Chili Garland** – Hung decoratively but shedding seeds.  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Sizzling Platter (Mongolian Beef Dish)** – **Weight: 8kg**, **Dimensions: 40x30cm**, **Temperature: 200°F+**. Requires two agents to carry safely.  \n- **Chinese Chicken Salad Mixing Bowl** – **Weight: 8kg when full**, **Dimensions: 50cm diameter**. Needs two people to mix and transport.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - **Five Soy Sauce Bottles** – Only one has a **blue cap** and **handwritten \"SWEET\" label**, but it’s next to a decorative blue vase (distractor).  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **flickering wok flame** needs adjustment.  \n  - **Solution:** The **gas regulator wrench** is in the backroom, inside a toolbox under spare napkins.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis environment is **rich with collaborative demands**:  \n- Servers must **communicate missing ingredients**.  \n- Chefs must **time dishes to prevent overcooking**.  \n- Bussers must **navigate cluttered spaces efficiently**.  \n\nThe **density of interactive objects**, **embedded problems**, and **realistic clutter** make this an ideal testbed for multi-agent AI coordination."
