Notable operation conditions include a conveying gas/coal ratio of 0.44, an oxygen/coal ratio of 0.715, a reaction temperature of 1,000 °C, and reaction pressure of 5bar in the case of Adaro coal; based on this, the cold gas efficiency was estimated as 82.19%. At the point of the reaction temperature effect, because the cold gas efficiencies are more than 80% when the reaction temperatures are higher than 900 °C, the gasifier inner temperature must remain over 900 °C. At high reaction temperature such as 1,400 °C, the reaction pressure shows little effect on the cold gas efficiency. The addition of steam into the gasifier causes an endothermic reaction, and then lowers the gasifier outlet temperature. This is regarded as a positive effect that can reduce the capacity of the syngas cooler located immediately after the gasifier. The most significant factor influencing the cold gas efficiency and the gasifier outlet temperature is the O2/coal ratio. As the O2/coal ratio is lower, the cold gas efficiency is improved, as long as the gasifier inner temperature remains over 1,000 °C. With respect to the calorific value (based on the lower heating value, LHV) of produced gas per unit volume, as the N2/coal ratio is increased, the calorific value per syngas unit volume is lowered. Decreasing the amount of nitrogen for transporting coal is thus a useful route to obtain higher calorific syngas. This phenomenon was also confirmed by the operation results.\n",
  "response": "# **Industrial Gasification Plant Control Room**  \n\n## **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nAn active **coal gasification plant control room** serves as the nerve center for monitoring and adjusting the high-temperature, high-pressure conversion of coal into synthetic gas (syngas). This environment is inherently collaborative, requiring operators, engineers, and technicians to work in tandem to maintain optimal reaction conditions, troubleshoot equipment failures, and prevent hazardous scenarios.  \n\nThe control room is **densely packed with monitoring stations, computational systems, and emergency equipment**, while adjacent areas house **maintenance tools, chemical storage, and manual override systems**. The high-stakes nature of industrial gasification ensures that **multi-agent coordination is mandatory**—some tasks (like recalibrating a heavy valve or responding to a pressure surge) cannot be performed alone.  \n\n---\n\n## **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n1. **Main Control Hub** – A semicircular room lined with **real-time monitoring screens, control panels, and alarm systems**. Dominated by a **central holographic reactor projection**, where operators adjust parameters.  \n2. **Maintenance & Tool Storage Closet** – Adjacent to the control hub, stocked with **calibration tools, spare parts, and emergency repair kits**.  \n3. **Gasifier Observation Deck** – A reinforced glass viewing platform overlooking the **actual reactor chamber**, with **manual override terminals** for emergency shutdowns.  \n4. **Chemical & Sample Prep Room** – A sealed lab space with **gas chromatographs, reagent bottles, and sample trays** for quality control.  \n5. **Break Room & Lockers** – A small, cluttered space with **coffee machines, personal lockers, and safety gear storage**, offering a brief respite for operators.  \n\n---\n\n## **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main Control Hub**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Central Holographic Reactor Display** (2m diameter, suspended, showing **real-time temperature/pressure graphs**).  \n- **Primary Control Console** (3m long, with **tactile sliders, emergency shutdown buttons, and biometric locks**).  \n- **Secondary Monitoring Stations** (four desks, each with **dual 32-inch displays**, showing **O2/coal ratios, N2 flow rates, and syngas purity**).  \n- **Overhead Alarm Array** (flashing **red/yellow/green** status LEDs, linked to **pressure/temperature thresholds**).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Master Override Keycard** (slotted into the primary console; **biometric-locked, requiring two operators to activate**).  \n- **Pressure Relief Valve Remote** (a **hand-cranked emergency bypass**, requiring **two people to turn simultaneously**).  \n- **Syngas Cooler Control Panel** (a standalone terminal with **manual steam injection dials**).  \n\n#### **c.
