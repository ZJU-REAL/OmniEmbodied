He lives in the Northwest Suburbs of Illinois with his girlfriend of five years. They hope to own property together someday, so tell everybody you know about this book, even people that you don´t think will like it very much. He is a member of the Bizarro fiction movement and is the winner of the First Annual Ultimate Bizarro Showdown. His books Murderland Part 1: H8 and Murderland Part 2: Life During Wartime have been published by hacker warlord Emperor Needle and his Evil Nerd Empire. He works for them as Sanitizer Overlord, which is every bit as awesome as it sounds. He still feels deeply connected to his past, but would rather it leave him alone. He is prone to strange fancies and dark moods. He is paranoid and a worrier. He is virtually unemployable, but he tries, dammit. He is happy sometimes, he is sad sometimes, he is human all of the time, more so than anything else, so don´t judge him as harshly as he does or as Clyde does.\n\nWhere to find Garrett Cook online\n\nWhere to buy in print\n\n\nArchelon Ranch\nPrice: $2.99 USD.

  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Bizarre Bio-Experimental Research Outpost*  \n**Core Concept:** A clandestine, high-tech laboratory hidden within the ruins of an overgrown \"jungle-city,\" where scientists conduct unethical experiments merging human consciousness with prehistoric creatures. The facility is half-functional, half-decaying, with wild flora encroaching on machinery, creating a surreal, hybridized environment.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment:** Massive containment chambers, bio-vats, and dinosaur-scale restraints require coordinated handling.  \n- **Precision Tasks:** Delicate neurosurgical tools, hazardous chemicals, and malfunctioning security systems demand specialized roles (e.g., \"biomechanic,\" \"specimen handler\").  \n- **Dynamic Threats:** Escaped hybrid creatures, unstable tech, and collapsing infrastructure force rapid, adaptive teamwork.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Jungle-Infested Entrance Hall**  \n   - **Purpose:** Transition zone between the wild exterior and controlled lab.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Vines choke broken security turrets; flickering neon signs read \"ARCHELON RANCH – WELCOME TEST SUBJECTS.\"  \n\n2. **Central Control Room (Partially Flooded)**  \n   - **Purpose:** Nerve center for monitoring experiments. Now derelict, with water dripping from ruptured pipes.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Holographic dinosaur brain scans glitch on cracked screens; a coffee mug grows mold.  \n\n3. **Specimen Containment Bay (Breached)**  \n   - **Purpose:** Formerly held hybrid creatures. Now, shattered glass and twisted metal cages suggest an escape.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** A stench of ozone and rotting meat. Scratches mar the walls at head height.  \n\n4. **Neural Synchronization Lab (Critical Zone)**  \n   - **Purpose:** Where human and dinosaur consciousnesses are forcibly merged.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** A surgical chair with leather straps, surrounded by humming EEG headsets. A chalkboard reads: \"SUBJECT BERNARD – PHASE 3: OBJECTIVITY OVERLOAD.\"  \n\n5. **Storage & Maintenance Closet (Cluttered)**  \n   - **Purpose:** Holds spare parts, chemicals, and tools—barely organized.  \n   - **Atmosphere:** Dusty shelves, a leaking coolant tank, and a faded \"SANITIZER OVERLORD\" nametag on the wall.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Jungle-Infested Entrance Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Security Checkpoint Turnstile (Jammed):** Rusted, vines threaded through its mechanism. Weight: ~200kg (requires 2+ agents to dislodge).  \n- **Shattered Aquarium Tank:** Once held bio-luminescent fish. Now a pool of stagnant water with floating scales.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Deactivated Turret (Repairable):** Requires a microfusion cell (located in Storage) and a multitool to reset.  \n- **\"Subject Intake Form\" Clipboard:** Lists Bernard’s last known vitals (clue for neural lab).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Dripping Pipe:** Creates a growing puddle (slippery terrain hazard).  \n- **Broken Biometric Scanner:** Beeps erratically, still scanning non-existent eyes.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti:** \"THEY’RE INSIDE US NOW\" scrawled in what looks like blood.  \n- **Dead Ferns:** In cracked ceramic pots, some with tiny fossilized bones in the soil.  \n\n#### **2. Central Control Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Mainframe Console (Critical):** 3m wide, covered in fungal growth. One monitor displays a looping error: \"CONTAINMENT FAILURE – SECTOR 5.\"  \n- **Hanging Dino-Skeleton:** A small raptor, wired with electrodes (used for early tests).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Backup Generator (Offline):** Needs fuel (ethanol bottles in Storage) and a manual crank (under desk).  \n- **Encrypted Hard Drive:** Requires a passcode (hint: \"Sanitizer Overlord’s birthday\" from the nametag).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Leaking Coffee Maker:** Puddle has corroded a patch of floor tiles.  \n- **Wall Fan (Stuck):** Creates a rhythmic creak—masking other sounds.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Photo:** Scientists posing with a tranquilized T-Rex (now torn).  \n- **\"Safety First\" Poster:** Peeling, with a dinosaur biting the \"F\" in \"First.\"  \n\n#### **3. Specimen Containment Bay (Breached)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Shattered Cryo-Pod:** Frost still clings to the edges. Weight: 500kg (unmovable alone).  \n- **Dino-Sized Restraint Harness:** Hanging loose, one strap torn clean off.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sedative Dart Gun (Empty):** On the floor; darts are in a locked cabinet (key in Control Room).  \n- **Bloodied Scrubs:** Smell of antiseptic and something feral.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Flickering UV Light:** Keeps some bioluminescent fungus at bay.  \n- **Spilled Nutrient Gel:** Slick, sticky, and slightly radioactive (Geiger counter clicks near it).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Chewed Lab Coat:** Sleeve ripped off, teeth marks too large for a human.  \n- **Child’s Drawing:** Taped to the wall—a dinosaur with a human face.  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n1. **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n   - **Cryo-Pod Door (500kg):** Must be lifted by 2+ agents to access the trapped scientist inside.  \n   - **Collapsed Bookshelf (Blocking Hallway):** Requires coordinated pulling to clear a path.  \n\n2. **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n   - **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five chemical bottles, only the **blue-capped \"Neuro-X\"** is non-lethal—but it’s next to a decorative blue vase (distractor).  \n   - **Compound Reasoning:** To fix the generator, agents must:  \n     1. Find ethanol in Storage (behind a locked cabinet).  \n     2. Retrieve the crank (hidden under Control Room desk).  \n     3. Avoid the leaking coolant (slippery + toxic).  \n\n**Final Note:** The scene is a pressure cooker of *bizarre science and survival*—where every object tells a story, every tool has a purpose, and collaboration isn’t optional."
