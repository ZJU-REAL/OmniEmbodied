They are firearms taken from arrests, search warrants or traffic stops. The guns could hold answers to unsolved violent crimes. But most police agencies wouldn t know that because they are not doing a basic ballistics test on the crime guns in their custody.\n\nIt s not just for TV shows\n\nThe Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) makes large scale ballistics testing possible. IBIS is part of a nationwide network that compares shell casings fired from guns to shell casings from all other guns that have been entered into the system. It s a high-tech system that reduces the human workload.\n\nIn Washington state there are more than 50,000 shell casings entered into the IBIS system.\n\nWhen a cartridge goes through a gun, that gun puts unique markings on it, said Terry McAdam, the manager of Washington State Patrol's Seattle crime lab. The cartridge casing is ejected from the gun and often left at the scene of a shooting.\n\nIBIS takes a picture of markings on the cartridge casing and looks for identical tool marks on other shell casings in the system. A match means the casings were fired from the same gun. That link may give investigators new leads to work on.\n\nWe ve also got many homicides solved because this particular cartridge case we found was linked to another homicide and once the police do further investigation they can link suspects to crimes, said McAdam. He calls it a very powerful weapon.\n\n\nTo get shell casings from crime guns into IBIS, police usually have to test-fire the weapon to produce two shell casings. They are then shipped off to the lab for analysis.\n\nBut 13 years after IBIS arrival in Washington state it appears many police agencies still do not have policies and procedures to take advantage of IBIS s potential.\n\nSeattle Police and Kent Police test-fire and submit all the crime guns in their evidence rooms. Tacoma Police test-fire a large percentage of them.\n\nBut other police agencies we examined aren t doing it.\n\nFew guns checked\n\nThrough public records requests, the KING 5 Investigators received inventories of crime guns in police property rooms. We compared that data with records from the crime lab showing how many cases each police agency has submitted for IBIS analysis.\n\nThose records show a low percentage of crime guns across the state of Washington are getting checked.\n\n\n  • Police in Spokane, the state s second largest city, requested IBIS tests on 2% of crime guns. Spokane PD has taken custody of more than 800 crime guns since 2010.\n\n  • Police in Bellevue, the fifth largest city, entered 2% of their 373 crime guns into IBIS.\n\n  • Federal Way, the tenth largest city, submitted 15% of their crime guns into IBIS.\n\nAmong the ten largest cities, the KING 5 Investigators found 2,818 crime guns in police possession that are not in the ballistics network.\n\nSeattle s record\n\nSeattle is the city with the most shootings and has the most to gain from IBIS.\n\nIt shows. Seattle police have a policy in place to test-fire and submit shell casings from each of the 300 or so crime guns officers take into custody each year.\n\nI think we as a state could do a much better job, said Seattle Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel, when presented with KING 5 s findings.\n\nPugel said his homicide investigators often see crime guns change hands and cross city lines. He said guns from Seattle crimes are probably sitting in evidence rooms in other jurisdictions right now.\n\nBut they won t find them if other jurisdictions don t enter their crime guns into IBIS.\n\nI believe that several crimes may be going unsolved, said Pugel.\n\nA family's grief\n\nGazelle Williams wonders if one of those crimes could be the one involving her nephew.\n\nThey could have the weapon that killed Desmond, she said of police agencies outside Seattle.\n\n22-year-old college student Desmond Jackson was gunned down in February in Seattle. The crime remains unsolved.\n\nJackson s murder was part of a violent first half of the year for the city. Nearly all of the 22 people slain in five months were killed with handguns.\n\nSeattle police picked up 13 shell casings on the SODO street where Jackson was killed. But IBIS will only find a match if a police agency not only crosses paths with that murder weapon, but also puts it into the IBIS system.\n\nThey could hold the key, said Williams. I would beg them to please test those guns. You know, maybe the gun that shot Des wouldn t be there but maybe it could solve someone else s family s crime\n\nMORE: Check out the KING5 Investigators' analysis of public records broken down by police department.

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Forensic Ballistics Lab & Evidence Processing Hub\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-tech **Forensic Ballistics Laboratory** serves as a central hub for processing firearms evidence from multiple police departments. The lab is tasked with:  \n- **Test-firing confiscated firearms** to generate shell casings.  \n- **Analyzing ballistic fingerprints** using the **Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS)**.  \n- **Cross-referencing unsolved crimes** by matching casings in the database.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Evidence handling requires coordination**—firearms are heavy, evidence must remain uncontaminated, and tasks like test-firing demand dual oversight.  \n- **Database analysis involves collaboration**—agents must verify matches, retrieve archived files, and update case records.  \n- **Logistical bottlenecks**—evidence rooms are overflowing, requiring organized sorting and prioritization.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe lab is divided into **five interconnected zones**, each with distinct functions:  \n\n1. **Evidence Intake & Storage** – A secured area where police drop off confiscated firearms. Overcrowded metal racks hold hundreds of tagged weapons.  \n2. **Ballistics Testing Range** – A reinforced firing booth where firearms are test-fired into a water tank to recover pristine shell casings.  \n3. **IBIS Analysis Station** – A high-tech workstation with microscopes, digital scanners, and a networked IBIS terminal.  \n4. **Forensic Workbench** – A cluttered space for manual casing inspection, chemical processing, and toolmark analysis.  \n5. **Case Coordination Office** – A small office with case files, whiteboards linking crimes, and a wall map showing jurisdictional overlaps.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Zone 1: Evidence Intake & Storage**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty steel evidence lockers** (1.5m tall, 200kg each, RFID-secured).  \n- **Overflow racks** (rusted, sagging under weight of unprocessed firearms).  \n- **Weigh station with digital scale** (max 50kg capacity).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Priority\" evidence bin** (marked \"URGENT – HOMICIDE CASES\").  \n- **Unlogged Glock 17** (serial number scratched off, tagged \"Bellevue PD Case #4472\").  \n- **Evidence submission forms** (half-filled, coffee-stained).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Barcode scanner** (low battery warning blinking).  \n- **Metal cart** (wobbly wheel, holds evidence bags).  \n- **Security camera** (red recording light on).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated \"Evidence Handling Protocol\" poster** (peeling at corners).  \n- **Dusty box of latex gloves** (almost empty).  \n- **Half-drunk energy drink** (condensation ring on paperwork).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Zone 2: Ballistics Testing Range**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Bullet recovery water tank** (3m long, reinforced glass, filled with discolored water).  \n- **Firing booth** (soundproofed, with mechanical clamps to secure firearms).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Jammed revolver** (cylinder stuck, requires tools to open).  \n- **Ejected casings tray** (five .45 ACP casings, one deformed).  \n- **Ear protection** (one pair missing).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Calibration tools** (misaligned, needs adjustment).  \n- **Cleaning kit** (oily rag draped over it).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"NO FOOD\" sign** (ignored, candy wrapper on floor).  \n- **Faded ballistics chart** (annotated in Sharpie).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Zone 3: IBIS Analysis Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **IBIS terminal** (dual monitors, fingerprint-locked).  \n- **High-resolution scanner** (dust on lens).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Pending casings tray** (12 samples awaiting upload).  \n- **\"MATCH FOUND\" alert** (blinking, unacknowledged).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label printer** (out of tape).  \n- **Reference manuals** (bookmarked with sticky notes).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Employee of the Month\" photo** (from 2018).  \n- **Dead potted cactus**.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **200kg evidence lockers** (require two agents to move safely).  \n- **3m water tank** (needs coordinated draining/refilling).  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based:** Among five .45 casings, **only one has a unique extractor mark** (visible under microscope).  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** **Jammed revolver** requires a **brass punch tool** (located in the Forensic Workbench).  \n\n#### **Distractors & Noise**  \n- **Decorative blue glass paperweight** (resembles a casing at a glance).  \n- **Outdated case files** (clutter the desk, must be sorted).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis environment is **deliberately dense**, forcing agents to:  \n- **Navigate procedural inefficiencies** (e.g., unlogged evidence).  \n- **Resolve physical constraints** (e.g., heavy objects, malfunctioning tools).  \n- **Filter signal from noise** (e.g., irrelevant casings, outdated docs).  \n\nThe result? A **rich, chaotic, but purposeful** lab where **every object tells a story**—and where **collaboration is the only way to solve crimes**."
