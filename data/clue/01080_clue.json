He has his own recipe for enjoying life--marry a working woman who will feed him all his life.\n\nHe lives with his mother, elder brother and sister, and is called Boss by everyone at home. He spends most of his time in his friend Sundar's hair-cutting salon and blows away much of Sundar's money on booze.\n\nHe meets Chandrika on a bus and falls in love with her and she takes a secret liking to him. He wants to marry her, but when he approaches her family with his proposal, they make fun of his jobless existence. This angers him and forces him to start a tutorial for Class X students after taking a loan from a local money lender.\n\nBhaskar makes a good profit from his tutorials, but Chandrika's father, who is a bank manager, still disapproves of the match.\n\nFull marks to Diganth for living his role. The role is tailor-made for him. Although Aindrita Ray cannot probably match Nayanthara's charm, she complements him with a good performance.\n\nSharan as the barber-friend is hilarious as always. Mukhyamantri Chandru makes a comeback after a long gap. Raghu Mukherjee makes a friendly appearance in the movie as the prospective bridegroom.\n\nMano Murthy's music is melodious but doesn't linger in one's memory. The title song and the hot number Mohisu.. are good.\nSrinivas's cinematography is pleasing; a major portion of the film was shot in Mysore. Director Prabhu Srinivas has remained faithful to the Tamil original.\n\nThis is a film for those who are in love. Go for it and enjoy.\n\nRediff Rating:\n\nSrikanth Srinivasa in Bangalore\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"The Valentine's Day Film Set Backlot\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling **film studio backlot** preparing for the final shooting day of *Parijatha*, a romantic Kannada film. The set is a **chaotic, multi-room mock-up** of key locations from the movie—a **barbershop, a tutorial center, a bank lobby, and a family home**—all interconnected in a warehouse-like soundstage.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Large-scale coordination** is needed to manage props, lighting, and actors.  \n- **Time-sensitive tasks** (e.g., resetting a scene before the next take) require parallel work.  \n- **Heavy equipment** (cameras, rigs, set pieces) demands collaborative movement.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe **soundstage** is divided into four key areas:  \n\n1. **Barbershop Set** – A small, cluttered salon with retro styling chairs, mirrors, and scattered grooming supplies. The back wall is a fake storefront window with a neon \"OPEN\" sign flickering intermittently.  \n2. **Tutorial Center Set** – A makeshift classroom with rows of wooden desks, a chalkboard covered in half-erased math equations, and stacks of student workbooks.  \n3. **Bank Lobby Set** – A partial construction with a marble-patterned vinyl floor, a faux teller counter, and a \"LOAN APPLICATIONS HERE\" sign hanging crookedly.  \n4. **Green Room & Props Storage** – A cluttered transitional space where actors prep, and crew stash spare costumes, spare lighting rigs, and misplaced props.  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Barbershop Set**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Vintage Barber Chair (120kg, hydraulic lift, slightly stuck in mid-height position)** – Leather upholstery peeling at the edges.  \n- **Wall-Mounted Mirror (2m x 1.5m, cracked lower-left corner, smudged with fingerprints)** – Surrounded by vanity bulbs, two of which are burnt out.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Broken\" Hair Clipper (missing a side guard, tangled power cord)** – Needed for a key prop reset between takes.  \n- **Fake Whiskey Bottle (filled with colored water, label peeling)** – Must be placed back on the shelf after each scene reset.  \n- **Taped Script Pages (yellow highlights, coffee-stained)** – Strewn across a counter, pages out of order.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Working Hairdryer (overheating after prolonged use)**  \n- **Spray Bottle (half-full of water, nozzle clogged)**  \n- **Rolling Tool Cart (wobbly left wheel, holding combs and scissors)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated Celebrity Posters (slightly curled at edges, one torn)**  \n- **Dusty Glass Jar of Marbles (labeled \"Tips – 2010\")**  \n- **Abandoned Coffee Cup (lipstick stain, cold)**  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Tutorial Center Set**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Teacher’s Desk (solid oak, right drawer jammed, covered in chalk dust)**  \n- **Blackboard (chalk writing partially smudged, bottom ledge holding three broken pieces of chalk)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Stack of Fake Exam Papers (top sheet marked \"FAILED\" in red ink)** – Must be shuffled and reset for continuity.  \n- **\"Loan Agreement\" Prop Document (hidden under a desk, coffee ring stain on corner)** – A misplaced critical prop.  \n- **Overhead Projector (bulb flickering, requires two people to adjust properly due to weight)**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Metal Desk Lamp (switch loose, casts uneven light)**  \n- **Wall Clock (battery dead, stuck at 3:17)**  \n- **Box of Chalk (mostly stubs, one piece wrapped in a \"DO NOT USE\" note)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti Carvings on Desks (\"R + S\" inside a heart)**  \n- **Forgotten Backpack (unzipped, spilling loose papers)**  \n- **Dried-out Potted Plant (leaves brittle, soil cracked)**  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Bank Lobby Set**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Teller Counter (fake marble veneer, one corner chipped, weight 80kg)**  \n- **Security Gate (non-functional, squeaky hinges, slightly misaligned)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Loan Application\" Forms (stacked neatly, except one crumpled under a chair)**  \n- **Fake Gold Bars (hollow, but sealed in a locked display case—key missing)**  \n- **\"Out of Order\" Stamp (ink pad dried out, needs replacement)**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Working LED Sign (\"Next Teller: Window 3\")** – Flickers occasionally.  \n- **Number Dispenser (missing the \"42\" ticket, jammed mechanism)**  \n- **Security Camera (non-functional, but lens cap left on)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Bank License (expiration date blurred)**  \n- **Dusty Fake Plant (one leaf hanging by a thread)**  \n- **Forgotten Umbrella (dripping wet, leaning against a chair)**  \n\n---  \n\n### **D. Green Room & Props Storage**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Costume Rack (overloaded, one wheel broken, hangers tangled)**  \n- **Makeup Station (mirror surrounded by bulbs, two not working)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Chandrika’s Necklace\" (missing one fake pearl, hidden under a makeup palette)**  \n- **\"Director’s Clipboard\" (last scene notes smudged, coffee spill on corner)**  \n- **Spare Camera Battery (charging, but red \"FAULT\" light blinking)**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Working Coffee Maker (half-full, stale)**  \n- **First Aid Kit (unlatched, bandages spilling out)**  \n- **Portable Fan (one blade bent, rattling noise)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Call Sheet (dates from last week, crumpled)**  \n- **Abandoned Script Revisions (marked \"OLD VERSION – DISCARD\")**  \n- **Dusty Trophy (\"Best Short Film – 2009\")**  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Overhead Projector (25kg, awkward shape)** – Requires two people to lift onto a stand without damaging cables.  \n- **Teller Counter (80kg, wobbly when moved)** – Needs coordinated effort to reposition without scratching the floor.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five **fake whiskey bottles**, only one has a **peeling label and a loose cap** (the prop needed for continuity). The others are sealed or contain different liquids.  \n  - The **gold bar display case** is locked, and the key is hidden in a **makeup drawer under a powder compact**—requiring deduction from scattered clues.  \n- **Compound Tool Use:**  \n  - The **broken hair clipper** can only be fixed by retrieving a **replacement guard** from the props storage—but it’s buried under a pile of mismatched costume pieces.  \n  - The **jam in the number dispenser** requires a **small screwdriver**, which is inside a tangled toolbox under a workbench.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Notes:** This **film set backlot** is a **high-density, multi-layered environment** where every object has a purpose, a state, and a potential role in collaborative tasks. The **\"noise\" of background props** (e.g., outdated posters, forgotten coffee cups) forces agents to **filter relevant details**, while **heavy or complex objects** ensure teamwork is essential. The scene is **ripe for dynamic problem-solving**, from prop retrieval to equipment troubleshooting."
