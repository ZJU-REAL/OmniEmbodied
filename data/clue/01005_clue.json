It is a dimeric protein composed of IL-12α and IL-27β chains, which are encoded by two separate genes called IL12A and EBI3, respectively. Secreted by regulatory T-cells (Tregs), IL-35 suppresses inflammatory responses of immune cells. IL-35 is not constitutively expressed in tissues, but the gene encoding IL-35 is transcribed by vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and monocytes after activation with proinflammatory stimuli. [1]\n\nStudies in mice show the absence of either IL-35 chain from regulatory Tregs reduces the cells' ability to suppress inflammation; this has been observed during cell culture experiments and using an experimental model for inflammatory bowel disease.[2] To produce its suppressive effects, IL-35 has selective activities on different T-cell subsets; it induces proliferation of Treg cell populations but reduces activity of Th17 cell populations.[3]\n\n\n  1. ^ Li X, Mai J, Virtue A, et al.

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"ImmunoLab Research Facility - Critical Cytokine Synthesis\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-security biomedical research lab specializing in cytokine synthesis and immune modulation. The facility is designed for collaborative research but is currently in a state of controlled chaos after an overnight equipment malfunction disrupted a critical IL-35 production batch. The environment is dense with scientific equipment, hazardous materials, and procedural documentation, requiring precise coordination between multiple agents to stabilize the lab, complete the synthesis, and prevent contamination.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- Heavy equipment requires coordinated lifting.  \n- Simultaneous monitoring of multiple instruments is needed.  \n- Security measures (locked storage, biometric access) necessitate role delegation.  \n- Contingency protocols require parallel task execution (e.g., stabilizing samples while repairing equipment).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n#### **A. Main Synthesis Lab**  \nThe primary workspace, dominated by a biosafety cabinet, centrifuges, and monitoring stations. Overhead LED panels display real-time cytokine analysis. The air hums with the sterile whine of HEPA filters. A faint smell of ethanol and refrigerated reagents lingers.  \n\n#### **B. Cold Storage & Sample Vault**  \nA refrigerated room (-20°C) with secured racks of biological samples. The door has a biometric scanner and emergency manual override. Frost clings to the hinges. Inside, backup IL-35 precursor vials are stored in clearly labeled but densely packed racks.  \n\n#### **C. Equipment Maintenance Bay**  \nAdjacent to the main lab, this area holds backup centrifuges, a broken autoclave, and scattered tools. A half-dismantled spectrometer sits on a rolling cart. Faded calibration stickers and a \"DO NOT USE\" sign hang on one machine.  \n\n#### **D. Monitoring & Control Room**  \nA glass-walled office with server racks, surveillance monitors, and a central command terminal. Papers with scribbled threshold values are taped to the screens. A whiteboard lists emergency contacts and protocol steps.  \n\n#### **E. Decontamination Airlock**  \nA transitional zone with PPE stations, UV sterilizers, and biohazard bins. A red light above the door indicates active decontamination cycles.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Synthesis Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Biosafety Cabinet (Class II):** 1.8m wide, stainless steel, with a cracked but still intact glass sash.  \n- **Centrifuge Array:** Three units (two operational, one displaying \"ERROR E-47\").  \n- **Refrigerated Microplate Reader:** 15kg, humming softly, screen displaying \"CALIBRATION REQUIRED.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **IL-35 Synthesis Batch (Priority Sample):** A rack of 12x 10mL vials (5 labeled \"STABLE,\" 7 \"DEGRADING\"), stored in a foam-lined tray.  \n- **Emergency Stabilizer Kit:** A sealed plastic case (30x20x10cm) containing glyoxal buffer, marked \"USE BEFORE EXPOSURE TO AIR.\"  \n- **Master Control Terminal:** Requires two-factor authentication (keycard + fingerprint). Currently flashing \"TEMPERATURE DEVIATION DETECTED.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Pipette Set:** Adjustable 1-10μL, resting on a calibration logbook.  \n- **Portable Incubator:** Small, 5kg, set to 37°C but unplugged.  \n- **Label Printer:** Out of thermal paper, with a half-printed label stuck in the feed.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Safety Certificates:** Slightly crooked on the wall.  \n- **Coffee Stains:** Dried rings near an old, chipped mug labeled \"WORLD’S BEST SCIENTIST.\"  \n- **Dusty Fume Hood Manual:** Tucked behind a stack of Petri dishes.  \n\n---\n\n#### **B. Cold Storage & Sample Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Biometric Lock Panel:** Red LED indicates \"ACCESS LOGGED.\"  \n- **Sample Racks:** Aluminum, with frost accumulation at joints.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Backup IL-12α/EBI3 Stocks:** In foam slots, each labeled with barcodes and expiry dates.  \n- **Emergency Thawing Kit:** Contains pre-warmed saline, sealed in a bright orange pouch.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Spare Gloves & Face Shields:** Hanging on a pegboard.  \n- **Digital Thermometer:** Reads \"-19.7°C\" with a low battery icon.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old Holiday Decorations:** A faded paper snowflake taped to the door.  \n- **Scratched \"DO NOT EAT\" Label:** On a clearly inedible storage box.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Broken Centrifuge (150kg):** Requires two agents to lift onto a repair dolly (stored near the bay).  \n- **Refrigerated Microplate Reader (15kg, fragile):** One agent can carry it, but navigating around obstacles (e.g., loose cables) demands coordination.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five chemical bottles, only **one** has a **blue cap, handwritten \"CORROSIVE,\"** and is **half-full.**  \n  - **Distractor:** Nearby decorative blue glassware could mislead an agent.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **\"Problem\":** The master terminal needs a keycard (stored in the control room desk).  \n  - **\"Solution\":** The desk is locked, but the key is hidden under a stack of outdated calibration reports.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes on Potential Tasks:**  \n- **Urgent Sample Stabilization:** Requires fetching the emergency kit while avoiding cross-contamination.  \n- **Equipment Repair:** Needs tool retrieval and coordinated handling.  \n- **Security Override:** Delegating access roles to bypass biometric locks.  \n\nThis lab is a **dense, high-stakes environment** where every object has purpose, every agent has a role, and collaboration isn’t optional—it’s survival."
