While Left and Right engage in their usual sparring over style, it’s the substance of the agreement that deserves scrutiny.\n\n1. The SPA calls on both sides to “initiate negotiations on a Bilateral Security Agreement. Negotiations should begin after the signing of this Strategic Partnership Agreement, with the goal of concluding within one year a Bilateral Security Agreement.”\n\nLet’s hope those negotiations go better than the negotiations the United States and Iraq engaged in throughout 2011. The U.S.-Iraq negotiations, it pays to recall, were building toward a long-term bilateral security partnership. American and Iraqi military commanders counted on the agreement to secure a modest-sized force of around 20,000 U.S. troops to train and back up Iraq’s nascent army. But those negotiations collapsed, and Washington abruptly left Iraq to fend for itself.\n\n 2. The SPA commits Afghanistan to providing “access to and use of Afghan facilities through 2014…for the purposes of combating al Qaeda and its affiliates.” Given Pakistan’s instability and al Qaeda’s goals, this is important to U.S. national security.\n\nRegarding al Qaeda, it was brought to light this month that bin Laden was working with his deputies, the Taliban high command and the Haqqani network on a plan for ousting Karzai and taking control of Afghanistan. Doubtless, those plans survived bin Laden’s passing, which means cross-border strikes against al Qaeda and its affiliates (who are in Pakistan) are key to America’s security—and Afghanistan’s viability.\n\n3. Related, the SPA views “any external aggression against Afghanistan” with “grave concern”—and appropriately so. Elements within Pakistan’s military-security apparatus are supporting a brutal guerilla war against the Afghan government and the U.S. military.\n\nYet in this same document, the United States “pledges not to use Afghan territory or facilities as a launching point for attacks against other countries”—countries that are harboring al Qaeda and its affiliates, countries that are countenancing aggression against Afghanistan, countries like Pakistan. It warrants mentioning that Pakistan is ground zero of America’s drone war precisely because its government is either unable or unwilling to target al Qaeda and its affiliates.\n\nThe SPA’s conflicting messages in this regard were highlighted by a nationwide address Karzai delivered just hours after signing the SPA and by Ambassador Ryan Crocker’s post-signing comments. Karzai emphasized that the SPA prohibits the U.S. from using Afghanistan to attack other countries, while Crocker countered that the SPA does not end the use of Afghanistan for conducting drone strikes in Pakistan.\n\n4. The document states that “cooperation between Afghanistan and the United States is based on mutual respect and shared interests.”\n\nTry telling that to the families of U.S., British and French troops who have been killed by their Afghan “allies.” There have been 18 attacks by uniformed Afghan troops on NATO forces this year, killing 11 allied troops; the most recent occurred last week. There were 45 such attacks, killing 70 allied troops, between 2007 and 2011. Given that NATO admits it’s only reporting incidents in which allied troops are killed, these numbers represent just a fraction of the problem.\n\n5. The SPA calls on NATO member states “to sustain and improve Afghan security capabilities beyond 2014 by taking concrete measures to implement” previous security agreements.\n\nThat seems unlikely. After all, NATO nations are slashing their militaries. To be sure, they will send some military aid to Afghanistan, but one wonders how much the NATO alliance will have left to sustain, let alone improve, security in Afghanistan.\n\n6. Finally, the document states that the U.S. and Afghanistan “reaffirm” their commitment to “defeating al Qaeda and its affiliates.”\n\nThere are several problems with this part of the SPA. First, NATO plans to reduce Afghan troop strength from 352,000 to 230,000 after 2014—just as NATO’s on-the-ground commitment recedes. One wonders how a smaller Afghan force—which despite its many shortcomings, still provides a modicum of stability—can defeat “al Qaeda and its affiliates” with less international support.\n\nMoreover, just how committed is Kabul to defeating “al Qaeda and its affiliates” if Kabul’s emissaries are talking to al Qaeda’s closest, oldest affiliate? That would be the Taliban.\n\nAfghanistan became the world headquarters for al Qaeda because the Taliban welcomed bin Laden with open arms. Yet Karzai consistently describes the Taliban as his “brothers.” In fact, Karzai devoted part of his nationwide address to calling on his “brothers” in the Taliban to “join the peace process and strengthen the nation.”\n\nClearly, Karzai’s goal is to draw the Taliban away from the battlefield and into the political sphere. But the Taliban are not prodigal sons. They are ruthless killers, committed jihadists, people who oppose everything that has happened in Afghanistan since the U.S. invaded on October 7, 2001. (One key objective of that invasion, of course, was to oust the Taliban.)\n\nNo matter what Karzai calls the Taliban, Mullah Omar and his henchmen have not changed their stripes. They turned Afghanistan into a medieval torture chamber, allowed al Qaeda to use their country as a terrorist campus and made 9/11 possible. In the years since they were toppled, their record has only gotten uglier: attacking girls’ schools with poison gas, murdering teachers and using children to plant IEDs.\n\nIt’s difficult to see why anyone would want to call them “brothers”—or how a free Afghanistan could survive their inclusion in the government.\n\nMore in The Landing Zone\n\n\nAdd new comment\n\nBy submitting this form, you accept the Mollom privacy policy.\n\nTell us what you think\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Diplomatic Crisis Coordination Center**  \n\n### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nInspired by the tense negotiations and strategic partnerships described in the text, this scene is a **high-stakes Diplomatic Crisis Coordination Center** located in a secure, neutral location (perhaps a UN facility or an international embassy). The environment is designed for rapid decision-making, intelligence sharing, and collaborative problem-solving among multiple agents representing different national and organizational interests.  \n\nThe space is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Complex tasks requiring delegation** (e.g., translating documents, cross-referencing intelligence, operating secure comms).  \n- **Physical collaboration demands** (e.g., moving classified equipment, handling heavy safes, coordinating emergency protocols).  \n- **Information asymmetry** (different agents have access to different data, requiring negotiation and reasoning).  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility is divided into **four key zones**, each serving a critical function:  \n\n1. **Main War Room** – The nerve center, dominated by a large digital map table, real-time satellite feeds, and secure comms stations.  \n2. **Secure Document Vault** – A restricted area for classified files, requiring biometric clearance.  \n3. **Translation & Intelligence Hub** – A workspace for linguists and analysts, filled with reference materials and live feeds.  \n4. **Emergency Briefing Chamber** – A soundproofed room for last-minute strategy sessions, equipped with a panic button and redundant comms.  \n\nEach area is **densely packed with objects**, ensuring no space feels sterile or underutilized.  \n\n---  \n\n## **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main War Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **3m x 5m interactive digital map table** (weight: 250kg, requires two people to reposition), displaying live drone footage and troop movements.  \n- **Three wall-mounted 85\" encrypted monitors** (showing satellite imagery, news feeds, and encrypted chat streams).  \n- A **heavy steel server rack** (bolted to the floor, humming faintly) housing classified comms equipment.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A locked briefcase (45x30x15cm, 12kg, biometric lock)** containing negotiation drafts.  \n- **A malfunctioning secure phone** (displaying \"ENCRYPTION ERROR,\" needs a technician).  \n- **A red-striped USB drive** (labeled “Eyes Only – BSA Draft”) plugged into a terminal.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A coffee machine** (half-full pot, stale smell, “Out of Order” sticky note).  \n- **A rolling whiteboard** (partially erased, marker stains on the tray).  \n- **A printer** (low toner, jammed with a crumpled page).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A faded \"OPERATION SECURE HORIZON\" poster** on the wall.  \n- **A dusty globe** (slightly tilted, Afghanistan marked with a pushpin).  \n- **A stack of outdated diplomatic cables** in a wire basket.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Secure Document Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A reinforced steel door** (biometric scanner, keypad, emergency manual override).  \n- **Floor-to-ceiling filing cabinets** (each drawer requires a keycard).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A mislabeled dossier** (marked “Agricultural Reports” but containing troop deployment plans).  \n- **A broken safe** (jammed, requires tools to pry open).  \n- **A half-shredded document** in the recycling bin (legible fragments suggest a leaked agreement).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A digital scanner** (out of paper, error light blinking).  \n- **A wall clock** (3 minutes slow, faint ticking audible).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A framed photo of a past summit** (glass cracked).  \n- **A forgotten lanyard** (ID badge missing) on a hook.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Translation & Intelligence Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Three workstations** (each with dual monitors, secure keyboards).  \n- **A reference bookshelf** (encyclopedias, legal texts, language dictionaries).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A partially translated document** (Urdu to English, last edit 2 hours ago).  \n- **A headset with a dead battery** (needs replacement).  \n- **A confidential fax** (half-received, jammed in the machine).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A landline phone** (off-hook, faint dial tone).  \n- **A coffee-stained notepad** (scribbled phone numbers).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A plant** (wilting, leaves yellowing).  \n- **A sticky note** (\"Call back Ambassador – URGENT\").  \n\n---  \n\n## **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The digital map table (250kg, 3m long)** requires two agents to adjust its position.  \n- **A locked steel cabinet (80kg, 2m tall)** must be moved to access a hidden emergency exit.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among **five USB drives**, only the **red-striped one** contains the BSA draft (others hold decoy data). A nearby **blue glass paperweight** adds visual noise.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The **malfunctioning secure phone** requires a **technician’s toolkit** (located in the Intelligence Hub), but the toolkit is locked in a drawer with a **keycard held by a different agent**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes on Potential Task Complexity**  \nThis scene is **deliberately dense**, forcing agents to:  \n- **Filter signal from noise** (e.g., distinguishing real intel from disinformation).  \n- **Coordinate under pressure** (e.g., fixing the secure phone before a critical call).  \n- **Resolve conflicts** (e.g., accessing the vault when clearance is split between two agents).  \n\nEvery object has **multiple layers of interactivity**, ensuring that tasks can be solved in **multiple valid (or invalid) ways**. The clutter of ambient details ensures agents must **reason precisely** rather than rely on simplistic object recognition.  \n\n**This is a stage set for intrigue, negotiation, and crisis management.** Now, who will step onto it?"
