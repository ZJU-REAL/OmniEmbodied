They charge about 5.5% of the transaction and then 55 cents. It's really ridiculous how much they think they deserve of a sale when their service is poor.\n\nI won't get into details because I don't want them to cancel our account as we're still with them (I'm sure they would actually over a bad review, it's just how these people tend to be). HOWEVER, when we signed up they misinformed us of a very important part of their policy. After 4 unique calls and finally getting to a person who knew what the company's policies really were, we got the information we originally wanted from the company. *The customer service team is NOT trained well*. I don't know who's responsible for that aspect of the company, but whoever it is, they are very lazy.\n\nNext, look at the checkout process. If you go through what the customer sees, you have pages upon pages at checkout. MAKE IT SIMPLE 2CHECKOUT! Why can't you just have a short, concise, easy to use checkout page? Everyone else does! If I were buying from our site, I'd personally be put off by the lengthy checkout page... which makes us actively seeking a better processor and will be leaving them with-in the next few months.\n\nI would never suggest this service to someone buying on-line or selling on-line. Look deeper, you can find something better.\n\nIt's not worth it.\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Theme:** *A Chaotic E-Commerce Fulfillment Warehouse Undergoing Systemic Overhaul*  \n\nThis scene depicts a bustling but disorganized fulfillment warehouse for an online retailer, where inefficiencies in logistics, poor training, and outdated systems have created a bottleneck in operations. The environment is inherently multi-agent due to the need for coordinated tasks—sorting mismanaged inventory, navigating cluttered workspaces, and troubleshooting malfunctioning equipment. The warehouse is mid-process of a rushed \"optimization\" effort, leaving half-implemented changes and conflicting workflows.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- Heavy objects (pallets, crates) require multiple workers to move.  \n- Complex sorting tasks (mislabelled boxes, ambiguous workflows) demand reasoning.  \n- Time-sensitive operations (e.g., express shipping) require delegation.  \n- Malfunctioning equipment (scanners, conveyors) needs cooperative troubleshooting.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Receiving Dock (Entry Point)** – A cluttered bay where shipments arrive. Pallets are haphazardly stacked, some with incorrect labels. A flickering fluorescent light hums overhead.  \n2. **Sorting & QC Zone (Central Hub)** – A maze of conveyor belts, some jammed or running backward. Tables hold half-sorted parcels, with mismatched barcodes. A whiteboard lists \"URGENT: NEW LABELING RULES (CONFLICTS WITH OLD SYSTEM).\"  \n3. **Packing Stations (Workbench Area)** – Workers scramble to assemble boxes. Tape guns are strewn about, some empty or jammed. A broken scale flashes \"ERR 404.\"  \n4. **Storage Shelves (High-Density Chaos)** – Overstuffed racks with boxes crammed in wrong slots. A handwritten note taped to a shelf reads: \"DO NOT USE – INVENTORY AUDIT PENDING.\"  \n5. **Shipping & Dispatch (Exit Point)** – A backlog of packages sits on a slow-moving conveyor. A printer spools out misaligned shipping labels. A red \"OVERDUE\" LED sign blinks.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Receiving Dock**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A hydraulic loading dock plate (stuck halfway, requires manual override).  \n- A rusted pallet jack (wheels squeak, handle sticky).  \n- Three industrial shelving units (one leaning dangerously, held up by a cinder block).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A sealed wooden crate (marked \"FRAGILE,\" shipping label smudged, 120kg weight).  \n- A clipboard with mismatched invoices (one lists \"24 units,\" another says \"30 units\").  \n- A jammed barcode scanner (error light blinking, requires battery replacement).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A working but slow label printer (out of red ink, only prints black).  \n- A rolling cart (one wheel wobbly, holds loose packing peanuts).  \n- A buzzing refrigerator (for worker lunches, door slightly ajar).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A faded OSHA poster (\"LIFT WITH YOUR LEGS!\") peeling off the wall.  \n- A half-empty coffee cup (stained, reads \"#1 PROCRASTINATOR\").  \n- A stack of water-stained cardboard sheets (unusable, warped).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Sorting & QC Zone**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A main conveyor belt (one section running backward).  \n- A sorting table (scratched surface, covered in sticky residue).  \n- A large wall-mounted monitor (flickering, displaying garbled shipping codes).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A bin of \"PRIORITY\" packages (mixed with standard ones, no clear distinction).  \n- A calibration weight set (scattered, missing the 1kg weight).  \n- A manual override lever for the conveyor (stiff, requires two people to pull).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A functioning but outdated barcode gun (slow response time).  \n- A label dispenser (tape frequently tangles).  \n- A rolling chair (one wheel missing, leans to the left).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A motivational poster (\"TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK\") covered in dust.  \n- A half-assembled Rubik’s cube on a desk (left by a bored worker).  \n- A dented metal trash can (overflowing with crumpled labels).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The wooden crate (120kg, requires two agents to lift safely).**  \n- **The pallet jack (stuck, needs one agent to pull while another resets the hydraulic release).**  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five nearly identical boxes in the Sorting Zone, only one has a **blue \"EXPRESS\" sticker hidden under a crumpled label** and weighs **2.3kg (vs. others at ~1.8kg).** A decorative blue clipboard nearby adds perceptual noise.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - To fix the jammed conveyor, agents must:  \n    1. Locate the **manual override lever (requires two people to pull).**  \n    2. Retrieve the **missing 1kg calibration weight (buried under loose packing slips).**  \n    3. Reboot the **wall monitor (password on a sticky note under the keyboard).**  \n\nThis environment is **deliberately layered with problems**—ambiguous labels, conflicting instructions, and faulty tools—forcing agents to **communicate, verify, and collaborate** to succeed.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** This warehouse is a nightmare of inefficiency, but that’s the point. Every object either **creates a problem to solve** or **provides a tool to solve it**—just like real-world logistics chaos. Agents must negotiate, prioritize, and sometimes **improvise** (e.g., using a crowbar as a lever if the pallet jack fails).  \n\nWould you like to add another layer of complexity (e.g., a time-sensitive \"Black Friday rush\" scenario)?"
