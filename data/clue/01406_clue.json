She said the rules are designed to reflect major advances in car technology.\n\nEnvironmental groups generally cheered the proposal, which they said would make consumers more aware of the environmental impact of cars.\n\nBut the proposed changes —which come as the Obama administration enforces stringent new rules to boost overall fuel economy—were criticized by the car industry, which said the government would be crossing the line between requiring responsible advertising and making value judgments about vehicles.\n\nThe government's proposed car labels would include bold letter grades. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n\"The proposed letter grade falls short because it is imbued with school-yard memories of passing and failing,\" said Dave McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry's largest trade group. A spokeswoman for the alliance added that \"grades may inadvertently suggest a government label of approval.\"\n\nSteve Cook, a Vassar, Mich., auto dealer, said he likes the idea of having a simpler labeling system that factors in more than fuel economy. But he questions the logic of the proposed rules.\n\n\"If a big SUV is going to be downgraded compared to a small car, that's not going to be effective because [the person] who is buying a truck already knows it uses more gas,\" Mr. Cook said.\n\nA more practical system would compare vehicles in the same size class for their environmental impact and fuel economy, he said.\n\nWith gasoline prices relatively stable over the past year, more U.S. consumers have been buying SUVs and trucks. Sales of small cars were up 7.8% this year through July, but sales of SUVs and crossovers rose nearly 21%.\n\nConsumers aren't strongly influenced by current EPA labels, in large part because they are complicated and not intuitive, said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for car shopping site Edmunds.com.\n\n\"People look at them undeniably, but there is a strong percentage of people who at the end of the day just buy the car they want most,\" Mr. Brauer said. The proposed changes could make more consumers think twice, he said.\n\nCurrently, the sticker prominently displays figures that reflect a car's mpg ratings for city and highway driving, and a dollar figure representing the estimated annual cost of fuel the car would use.\n\nThe new sticker would be closer to an advertisement, with a letter grade atop a phrase such as \"Saves $1,900\" that reflects how much less the car would use in gas than the average car in its class.\n\nThe new sticker also would display figures reflecting how many gallons the car uses per 100 miles of driving; its city and highway mpg ratings; how much carbon dioxide it emits; and the annual fuel cost. And it would give the range of fuel economy for all vehicles in the same class.\n\nThe new rules wouldn't go into effect until the 2012 model year, and officials are holding a 60-day public-comment period for suggested alterations.\n\nThe EPA and DOT also have proposed a less-contentious version of labels that wouldn't include the letter grades, and is asking the public which version it prefers.\n\nThe auto industry has been anticipating the changes as a number of car companies prepare to begin selling advanced-technology vehicles in the U.S. in coming months. Those include General Motors Co.'s Chevrolet Volt, a battery car that uses gasoline to power a generator beyond certain distances, and Nissan Motor Co. 's all-electric Leaf.\n\nGM created a stir—and raised questions about the current system—when it said last year the Volt would get 230 miles per gallon under a preliminary EPA formula. GM said in a statement Monday it continues to work with the EPA and DOT on labeling standards for such vehicles.\n\nThe new proposal stops short of forcing the labels to contain more information on the environmental impact of the electricity used to charge electric cars. Environmental groups have argued the government and car makers should provide the public with information on these \"upstream emissions,\" the pollution associated with coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe EPA's McCarthy said the agency was constrained by federal statutes that specify only tailpipe emissions, not upstream emissions, be included on the label. But Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said the agency wouldn't have been blocked from providing more information on emissions from power plants.\n\nCorrection & Amplification:\nThe Ford Focus is among vehicles that would receive a B grade under a government proposal to rate cars on their fuel efficiency and emissions. A graphic in an earlier version of this article showed a picture of the Ford Fusion instead of the Focus.\n\n—Sharon Terlep and Mike Ramsey contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@dowjones.com\n",
  "response": "# **Concept: \"Eco-Vehicle Certification Lab\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling **vehicle emissions testing and certification laboratory**, where teams of inspectors, engineers, and technicians collaborate to assess, grade, and label new car models based on environmental impact. The lab is a hybrid workspace—part industrial garage, part data analysis hub—where physical testing meets bureaucratic record-keeping.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy machinery** requires coordinated handling (lifting, moving, securing vehicles).  \n- **Precision tool use** necessitates specialized roles (one agent operates diagnostic scanners while another logs data).  \n- **Time-sensitive workflows** (testing cycles, paperwork deadlines) demand parallel task execution.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n### **A. Vehicle Testing Bay**  \n- A high-ceilinged industrial space with hydraulic lifts, emission sniffers, and reinforced flooring.  \n- **Key Features:** Overhead crane system, retractable power cables, wall-mounted safety signage.  \n\n### **B. Data Analysis Station**  \n- A clustered workstation with multiple monitors, networked terminals, and a central display showing real-time emissions data.  \n- **Key Features:** Whiteboard with testing schedules, labeled USB drives, a coffee-stained procedural manual.  \n\n### **C. Certification Office**  \n- A cramped administrative zone with filing cabinets, a label printer, and a wall of sample stickers (A to C- grades).  \n- **Key Features:** A locked drawer for final approval stamps, a backlogged inbox, a half-finished \"Eco-Rating Explained\" pamphlet.  \n\n### **D. Parts & Tools Storage**  \n- Shelving units packed with diagnostic tools, spare sensors, and calibration equipment.  \n- **Key Features:** A rolling tool cart, a \"Borrow & Return\" clipboard with missing entries, a dented locker with personal belongings.  \n\n### **E. Break Area (Ambient Noise Zone)**  \n- A small kitchenette with a fridge, microwave, and a bulletin board cluttered with memos and car ads.  \n- **Key Features:** A broken vending machine, a \"Fuel Efficiency Challenge\" poster, mismatched mugs in a drying rack.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Vehicle Testing Bay**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Hydraulic Lift (2000kg capacity, currently raised with a midsize SUV clamped in place).**  \n- **Emission Analyzer Station (Wall-mounted, connected to sniffer probes via coiled tubes).**  \n- **Overhead Crane (5-ton limit, remote control dangling from a hook).**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Portable Diagnostic Scanner (Battery at 30%, last calibration date sticker peeling).**  \n- **\"Test in Progress\" Tag (Hanging from the SUV’s mirror, with a handwritten \"CO2 spike @ 2500 RPM\").**  \n- **Fuel Sample Canister (Sealed, labeled \"Batch #7E—High Sulfur Content\").**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Tool Chest (Locked, combo written on a sticky note under the keyboard).**  \n- **Safety Cones (Stacked crookedly near the bay door).**  \n- **Drip Pan (Under the SUV, slightly greasy).**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Faded \"Zero Emissions Initiative\" Banner (Torn at one corner).**  \n- **Dusty Trophy (\"Best Eco-Innovation 2018\").**  \n- **Coffee Ring Stains on a Workbench.**  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Data Analysis Station**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Triple-Monitor Workstation (One screen flickering intermittently).**  \n- **Network Server Rack (Blinking LEDs, fan humming loudly).**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Unapproved Grading Sheet (SUVs marked \"C-,\" circled in red with \"REVIEW\" scrawled in margin).**  \n- **Encrypted Hard Drive (Labeled \"Confidential—Pending Audit\").**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Label Printer (Out of yellow ink, error light blinking).**  \n- **Reference Binder (\"EPA Standards 2023 Edition,\" dog-eared).**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Sticky Notes (With phone numbers, one reading \"Call GM re: Volt rating\").**  \n- **Toy Hybrid Car Model (On shelf, missing a wheel).**  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Certification Office**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Approval Stamp Desk (Locked drawer, key on a lanyard around a chair leg).**  \n- **Filing Cabinet (Overstuffed, drawer slightly jammed).**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Final Grading Sheet (An electric car marked \"A,\" awaiting stamp).**  \n- **Misprinted Labels (A batch with smeared ink in a recycling bin).**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Paper Shredder (Overheating light on).**  \n- **Wall Clock (Stopped at 3:17).**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Framed Newspaper (\"EPA Introduces Letter Grades for Cars – 2011\").**  \n- **Dying Potted Plant (Leaves browning).**  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The 2000kg hydraulic lift** requires two agents to stabilize while lowering a vehicle.  \n- **The 5-ton overhead crane** cannot be safely operated solo—one agent must guide the load while another controls the remote.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five fuel samples, only **Batch #7E** has a handwritten warning—but an identical-looking decorative **blue glass bottle** nearby adds noise.  \n- **Compound Tool Use:** A **locked filing cabinet** holds final approvals—the key is **hidden under a keyboard**, but a **distractor keyring** hangs nearby.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** This environment is **dense with intentional clutter**, forcing agents to **navigate noise while solving layered tasks**. The balance of **critical objects** and **mundane distractions** ensures robust reasoning and collaboration."
