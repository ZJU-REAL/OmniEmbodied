Try to get you to stay away from the unhealthy foods and fluids. We offer an array of products for losing weight, maintaining weight and for gaining muscle.\n\nThe foods we buy at the store are not what they once were due to a multi-tude of factors, we don't get the omega's that we need, nor the vitamins; Obesity in America is beyond an epidemic and only getting worse. How many people have made changes in their food options to lose weight, they lose 10 to 20 lbs hit a wall, get frustrated and go rite back to where they were before they lost the weight.\n\nA. Shop the perimeter of the store\nB. If it's sealed in plastic you probably shouldn't be eating it.\nC. More water (your weight times .5= how many ounces you should be drinking of water), less everything else\nD. Exercise - not for hours on end but for at least 30 minutes everyday\nE. 5 to 6 small meals a day, Breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, dinner. if you need something after 7 at night drink water, don't eat becuase your bored watching the idiot box.\njeeperstrudie is offline   Reply With Quote\nPage generated in 0.05652 seconds with 20 queries\n",
