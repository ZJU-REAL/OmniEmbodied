Extra fuel cartridges will cost much the same as disposable alkaline batteries, it says.\n\nSeveral other products are under development, says Horizon, which is also scaling up the size of its solutions.\n",

Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-tech **Hydrogen Fuel Cell Research Lab**, bustling with engineers, scientists, and technicians working on next-generation portable power solutions. The lab is a hive of multi-agent collaboration, where teams must coordinate to test, assemble, and troubleshoot fuel cell prototypes. The scene is dense with fragile equipment, hazardous materials, and interdependent workflows, demanding precise coordination and problem-solving.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- Heavy or bulky objects (fuel cell stacks, gas canisters) require multiple people to move safely.  \n- Complex testing procedures involve synchronized actions (one agent monitors voltage, another adjusts hydrogen flow).  \n- Safety protocols mandate supervision (one agent handling volatile chemicals, another verifying procedures).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe lab is divided into four interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Main Testing Bay** – Central hub with workbenches, diagnostic tools, and active experiments.  \n2. **Assembly Station** – Where fuel cell components are pieced together with precision tools.  \n3. **Storage & Supply Closet** – Houses volatile hydrogen cartridges, spare parts, and safety gear.  \n4. **Monitoring & Control Desk** – A workstation with live telemetry feeds and emergency shutoffs.  \n\n**Architectural Features:**  \n- **Sliding glass partitions** separate zones while maintaining visibility.  \n- **Overhead gantry rails** for transporting heavy modules.  \n- **Emergency showers & fire extinguishers** at key junctions.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Testing Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Hydraulic workbench (1.5m x 3m, height-adjustable)** with built-in clamp mounts for securing fuel cells.  \n- **Multi-channel oscilloscope** on a wheeled cart, currently displaying erratic voltage spikes.  \n- **Overhead fume extraction arm** (retracted, needing repositioning).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Prototype MiniPak fuel cell (disassembled)**, its PEM membrane slightly warped from overheating.  \n- **USB load tester** flickering between 1.2W and 1.8W, indicating instability.  \n- **Leaking hydrogen cartridge** (5% full, hissing faintly) beside a sealed replacement.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Calibration multimeter** with a frayed probe wire.  \n- **Soldering station** (idle, tip crusted with oxidation).  \n- **Anti-static mats** (one curled at the edge, tripping hazard).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed patent diagrams** for \"Solid-State Hydrogen Storage.\"  \n- **Whiteboard** with half-erased equations and a doodle of a rocket.  \n- **Stained coffee mug** labeled \"WORLD’S OKAYEST ENGINEER.\"  \n\n---\n\n#### **B. Assembly Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Electrostatic discharge (ESD)-safe workbench**, grounded, with magnifying lamp.  \n- **Micro-solder reflow oven** (display reads \"COOLING DOWN\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Unlabeled metal hydride powder canister** (blue lid, 500g remaining).  \n- **Misplaced PEM gasket kit** (correct one has a red \"VERIFIED\" sticker).  \n- **Half-assembled cartridge** missing its pressure-release valve.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Tweezers** in a magnetic holder (one pair bent).  \n- **Bin of defective O-rings** (mixed with usable ones).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"DAYS SINCE LAST INCIDENT: 3\"** safety counter.  \n- **Stack of outdated datasheets** for discontinued fuel cells.  \n\n---\n\n#### **C. Storage & Supply Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Explosion-proof cabinet** (locked, requires keycard).  \n- **Refrigerated shelf unit** for hydrogen storage (–20°C, humming loudly).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed hydrogen cartridge (12Wh)** with a **scratched barcode**, making inventory tracking ambiguous.  \n- **Spill containment kit** (unopened, buried under spare tubing).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Overflowing hazmat disposal bin** (needs emptying).  \n- **Spare lab coats** (one missing its left sleeve).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded \"NO OPEN FLAMES\" poster** with a burn mark near the corner.  \n\n---\n\n#### **D. Monitoring & Control Desk**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Triple-monitor setup** streaming live telemetry (one screen frozen).  \n- **Emergency stop button** under a protective flip-cover.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Logbook** with an **unsigned safety checklist**.  \n- **Unacknowledged low-hydrogen alarm** blinking silently.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Wireless keyboard** (sticky \"Enter\" key).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"FUEL CELLS = FUTURE\"** motivational poster.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Fuel Cell Stack (80kg, 1.2m tall)** – Requires two agents to lift onto the hydraulic bench.  \n- **Hydrogen Refrigerator Door (stuck)** – Needs one agent to pull while another loosens the seal with a pry tool.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Identifying the Correct Canister:**  \n  - Five **metal hydride canisters** sit on the shelf. Only one has a **red \"CERTIFIED\" stamp**, but it’s partially obscured by a **dusty safety manual**.  \n  - Agents must cross-check the **logbook’s lot numbers** to confirm.  \n\n- **Compound Problem-Solving:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **oscilloscope shows erratic readings**.  \n  - **Solution:** The **frayed multimeter probe** must be replaced using the **spare wires** in the Assembly Station, but they’re locked in the **ESD-safe drawer** (keycard in the lab coat pocket).  \n\nThis lab is a **playground for embodied AI collaboration**, where agents must navigate physics, tool dependencies, and procedural constraints to succeed. Every object has a role—whether critical, distracting, or atmospheric."
