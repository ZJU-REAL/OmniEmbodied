  "response": "# **Scene Concept: High-End Restaurant Kitchen & Wine Cellar**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Scene Type:** A bustling, high-end restaurant kitchen and its adjacent wine cellar, mid-service during peak dining hours.  \n\n**Core Concept:** This is a pressure-filled, fast-paced environment where precision and teamwork are essential. The kitchen is alive with multiple stations—grill, pastry, plating, and prep—each requiring synchronized effort to deliver flawless dishes. The attached wine cellar is a labyrinth of rare vintages, requiring careful handling and coordination to retrieve the correct bottles. The scene naturally demands multi-agent collaboration due to:  \n- **Time Pressure:** Orders must be prepared and delivered quickly.  \n- **Physical Constraints:** Heavy equipment, delicate plating, and fragile inventory necessitate teamwork.  \n- **Complex Workflows:** Multiple interdependent processes (cooking, plating, wine pairing) require coordination.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\nThe space is divided into **four interconnected zones**:  \n\n1. **Main Kitchen (Hot Line)** – The heart of the operation, with sizzling grills, fryers, and plating stations.  \n2. **Prep Station** – Where ingredients are chopped, sauces are reduced, and garnishes are prepared.  \n3. **Wine Cellar** – A climate-controlled room lined with racks of wine bottles, some extremely rare and valuable.  \n4. **Expediting Area** – The final checkpoint where dishes are assembled, inspected, and sent to the dining room.  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main Kitchen (Hot Line)**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **6-burner gas range with overhead ventilation hood** (sizzling, grease-splattered)  \n- **Flat-top grill** (searing chicken, faint char marks visible)  \n- **Deep fryer** (oil bubbling at 375°F, safety latch engaged)  \n- **Stainless steel plating station** (warmed from below, with heat lamps overhead)  \n- **Overhead shelves with stacked copper pans** (some slightly tarnished from frequent use)  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Breading station** (pie plate filled with seasoned flour, shallow dish of heavy cream)  \n- **Chicken breasts** (pounded to ½-inch thickness, resting on a plastic-wrapped cutting board)  \n- **Tomato relish bowl** (freshly mixed, covered with plastic wrap)  \n- **Lemon butter sauce pan** (still warm, fine-mesh strainer resting nearby)  \n- **Digital meat thermometer** (probe extended, last reading: 145°F)  \n\n#### **c.

Wine Cellar**  \n\n#### **a.

Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The 1945 Chateau Haut-Brion bottle** (weight: 3.5kg, **requires two agents**—one to unlock the display case, another to carefully lift it).  \n- **The industrial mixer bowl** (12kg when full of dough, **requires two agents** to carry without spilling).  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among the five nearly identical saucepans, only **one has a blue silicone handle** (the others are black). This is crucial because it's the only one rated for high-heat reduction tasks.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The **\"undercooked\" salmon dish** must be re-fired, but the grill is occupied. Agents must:  \n  1. **Locate the backup induction burner** (hidden behind stacked trays).  \n  2. **Fetch the correct pan** (copper-bottomed, hanging on the far rack).  \n  3. **Monitor the temperature** (using the digital thermometer from the"
