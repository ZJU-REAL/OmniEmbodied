Nobody gave a **** that loud sex was happening. And nobody that i know gives a **** either, in fact, it's only here, on the internet, that i hear about people refusing to have sex because their parents or anyone else are home.\n\nWhy is that? I am not trying to be edgy, i am genuinely curious..\n#45 to #35 - dumerveil has deleted their comment [-]\nUser avatar #47 to #45 - hemming (08/23/2013) [-]\nSoo, basically you're saying it's because they are not allowed?\n#48 to #47 - dumerveil has deleted their comment [-]\nUser avatar #49 to #48 - hemming (08/23/2013) [-]\nThat's weird..\nSex is a pretty casual thing in my social circle.. or not just my circle, pretty much everyone i know..

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: The Teenage Basement Hideaway – A High-Stakes Covert Operations Hub**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA subterranean teenage sanctuary repurposed as a **multi-agent covert operations center**, where agents must collaborate to complete missions while avoiding detection by \"parental units\" upstairs. The basement is densely packed with **improvised surveillance equipment**, **hidden compartments**, and **distraction systems**, all requiring coordinated effort to operate.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Large Objects:** Some items (e.g., a couch hiding a secret compartment) require multiple agents to move.  \n- **Distributed Tasks:** One agent may need to monitor \"parental movement\" while another retrieves contraband.  \n- **Tool-Based Problem Solving:** Locked containers, jammed equipment, and improvised tools necessitate reasoning and cooperation.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe basement is divided into **four zones**, each with distinct functions:  \n\n1. **\"Mission Control\" (Main Lounge Area)**  \n   - A sunken pit with a **worn-out sectional couch** (one cushion hides a storage compartment).  \n   - **Improvised surveillance setup**: A repurposed baby monitor, a laptop streaming security cam footage (from a hacked smart doorbell upstairs).  \n   - **Ambient noise generator**: A rumbling dehumidifier masks sounds.  \n\n2. **\"The Armory\" (Storage Closet Under the Stairs)**  \n   - A **padlocked metal cabinet** (contains \"restricted items\" like a fake ID, a spare phone, and a bottle of cheap cologne).  \n   - **Hidden floor panel** (leads to a crawlspace with a backup escape route).  \n\n3. **\"Distraction Zone\" (Laundry Corner)**  \n   - **A rickety washing machine** (set to \"heavy spin\" as a noise cover).  \n   - **A pile of \"decoy chores\"**—folded laundry, a half-assembled IKEA shelf.  \n\n4. **\"Escape & Evasion\" (Back Window Nook)**  \n   - A **partially blocked window** (covered by a dusty AC unit, but removable with effort).  \n   - **A rope ladder coiled underneath a pile of old skateboards**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. \"Mission Control\" (Main Lounge Area)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Sectional Couch (Left Side Sags)** – One cushion conceals a **hidden compartment** (spring-loaded, requires two people to lift).  \n- **TV Stand with \"Broken\" Leg** – Propped up by old textbooks. **A vintage CRT TV** (left on mute, displaying static).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Baby Monitor (Model: SecureEar 2000)** – Crackling audio feed from upstairs. **Battery at 12%**.  \n- **\"Parental Radar\" Laptop** – Displays a crude floorplan with dots indicating movement upstairs. **Wi-Fi signal weak (1 bar)**.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Dehumidifier (Loud, rumbling)** – Set to \"MAX\" as a noise screen. **Water tank 80% full**.  \n- **Mini-Fridge (Sticker-covered)** – Contains **two warm energy drinks and a moldy sandwich**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Band posters (slightly peeling at corners)** – One has a **hidden Morse code cheat sheet** scribbled in Sharpie behind it.  \n- **Dusty gaming controllers** – One has **a sticky A button**.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. \"The Armory\" (Storage Closet Under the Stairs)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Padlocked Metal Cabinet (Rusty hinges, combo lock)** – Requires **correct 4-digit code** (hint: written on a gum wrapper in the couch).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Fake ID (Slightly bent, \"Height: 6'2\"\" when owner is 5'9\")** – Hidden under a false bottom in a **Pringles can**.  \n- **\"Emergency\" Walkie-Talkie (Low battery, earpiece missing)** – Tuned to **police scanner frequency**.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Toolbox (Half-open, missing screwdriver)** – Contains **duct tape, pliers, and a single AA battery**.  \n- **Duffle Bag (Stained, smells like gym socks)** – Holds **a crumpled fast-food uniform (decoy disguise)**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Stack of old magazines** – Top issue has **\"10 Ways to Be More Stealthy\" circled**.  \n- **Broken skateboard deck** – Used as **a makeshift shelf**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The Sectional Couch Hidden Compartment** – The mechanism is **stuck** (requires two agents to lift simultaneously while a third pulls a release cord under the TV stand).  \n- **Blocked Window Escape Route** – The **AC unit (45kg)** must be moved (two-person lift) to access the rope ladder.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **identical-looking Pringles cans**, only **one** has a **false bottom** (identified by a **small scratch near the rim**).  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The **padlocked cabinet** requires:  \n  1. Finding the **gum wrapper code** (hidden in the couch).  \n  2. Using **pliers from the toolbox** to pry open the **rusted latch**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis scene is **designed for tension and collaboration**, forcing agents to:  \n- **Monitor parental movement** while executing tasks.  \n- **Improvise tools** (e.g., duct tape + skateboard = makeshift ramp).  \n- **Work under time pressure** (e.g., \"Parental unit descending stairs in 2 minutes!\").  \n\nThe **density of decoy objects** (magazines, random clutter) ensures agents must **filter signal from noise**, just like real-world operations.  \n\nWould you like any refinements or expansions on specific mechanics?"
