It grows in dry woodlands and forest edges and can reach 4–8 metres (13–26 ft) tall with stems 10–25 centimetres (3.9–9.8 in) thick with smooth gray bark. The leaves are rounded oval, coarsely double-toothed, 5–11 centimetres (2.0–4.3 in) long and 3–8 centimetres (1.2–3.1 in) broad, with hairy undersides. The flowers are catkins that form in the fall and pollinate in the following spring.\n\nCorylus cornuta is named from its fruit, which is a nut enclosed in a husk with a tubular extension 2–4 centimetres (0.79–1.57 in) long that resembles a beak. Tiny filaments protrude from the husk and may stick into, and irritate, skin that contacts them. The spherical nuts, which are surrounded by a hard shell, are edible.\n\nThere are two varieties:[1]\n\n  • Corylus cornuta var. cornuta – Eastern Beaked Hazel. Small shrub, 4 to 6 m tall;[1] 'beak' longer, 3 cm or more.\n  • Corylus cornuta var. californica – Western Beaked Hazel or California Hazelnut. Large shrub, 4 to 15 m tall;[1] 'beak' shorter, usually less than 3 cm. The Concow tribe called this variety gōm’-he’’-ni (Konkow language).[2]\n\nThe seeds are dispersed by jays and rodents such as red squirrels and least chipmunks.[1] Although C. cornuta is somewhat shade tolerant, it more common in open forests than denser ones.[1] Fire kills the above-ground portion of the shrub, but it resprouts fairly readily after fire, and in fact American Indians in California and Oregon used fire to encourage hazelnut growth, as they used hazelnuts for food, baskets, medicine, and other purposes.[1]\n\n\n  1. ^ a b c d e f Fryer, Janet L.

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Wildlife Research Field Station & Nut Processing Lab\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA remote **Wildlife Research Field Station** nestled at the edge of a dense North American woodland, specializing in the study and sustainable harvest of **Beaked Hazel (Corylus cornuta)**. The station serves as a hybrid workspace—part ecological research lab, part nut-processing facility, and part supply depot for field expeditions. The environment inherently demands **multi-agent collaboration** due to:  \n- Heavy, bulky equipment requiring coordinated transport.  \n- Precise sample handling and documentation needing multiple roles (researcher, technician, field scout).  \n- Time-sensitive processes (e.g., nut drying, data logging) requiring parallel workflows.  \n\nThe station feels **lived-in and slightly chaotic**, with evidence of ongoing work—half-filled specimen jars, hastily scribbled notes, and the faint earthy scent of hazelnuts mixed with lab disinfectant.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe station is divided into **five interconnected areas**:  \n\n1. **Main Research Lab** – The hub of scientific activity, equipped with microscopes, sample trays, and drying racks.  \n2. **Field Prep & Storage** – A cluttered staging area with backpacks, GPS units, and hazelnut collection bins.  \n3. **Nut Processing Room** – A semi-industrial space with mechanical shellers, sorting belts, and storage crates.  \n4. **Outdoor Observation Deck** – Overlooking the forest edge, with binoculars, weather instruments, and a small burn scar from controlled fires (used to promote hazelnut growth).  \n5. **Staff Lounge / Documentation Corner** – A small break area with a coffee maker, laptops, and pinned field notes.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Research Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- A **sturdy oak workbench (2m x 1m, 80kg)** with built-in drawers, bolted to the floor.  \n- A **wall-mounted specimen drying rack (1.5m wide, aluminum frame)**, holding mesh trays of hazelnuts in various stages of dehydration.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Microscope (on, displaying a magnified hazelnut husk fiber sample)** with an attached **digital camera (memory card 75% full)**.  \n- **Glass specimen jar (500ml, sealed, labeled \"C. cornuta var. californica – Site 7B\")**, filled with husk fragments.  \n- **Field notebook (open, last entry: \"Increased rodent activity near Site 4 – possible cache theft?\")** with a **chewed pencil (teeth marks suggest rodent gnawing)** beside it.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Lab scale (digital, powered on, last tare weight: 0g)** with an **empty weighing boat (plastic, 5g)** beside it.  \n- **Adjustable desk lamp (LED, 5000K, flickering slightly)** illuminating a **stack of petri dishes (some with fungal cultures growing)**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Framed botanical illustrations** of hazel species on the wall, slightly askew.  \n- **A potted spider plant (dusty, slightly wilted)** on a high shelf.  \n- **A corkboard** cluttered with **old conference badges, a faded trail map, and a pinned warning: \"HUSK FIBERS – WEAR GLOVES!\"**  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Field Prep & Storage**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Heavy-duty metal shelving unit (3m tall, 200kg, bolted to wall)** loaded with field gear.  \n- **Wooden crate stack (each crate 60x40x30cm, ~25kg when full, labeled \"HARVEST – DO NOT STACK >3 HIGH\")**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **GPS tracker (battery at 30%, last used 2 days ago)** with a **mud-smeared lanyard**.  \n- **Collapsible hazelnut collection basket (folded, canvas, 1.5kg, small tear in mesh)**.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **First aid kit (wall-mounted, partially open, missing bandages)**.  \n- **Water canteens (stainless steel, three empty, one half-full)**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **A dusty pair of hiking boots (size 10, left untied)** kicked under the shelving.  \n- **A faded \"LEAVE NO TRACE\" wilderness ethics poster** peeling at the corners.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The wooden harvest crates (25kg each, too heavy for one agent)** must be moved from the **Field Prep** area to the **Nut Processing Room**—requiring two agents to lift safely.  \n- **The oak workbench (80kg, bolted but movable with tools)** could be repositioned only if agents first **remove drawers (each 10kg, contents: lab tools)** and **unbolt it (wrench required, stored in the Storage area)**.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among **five hazelnut specimen jars**, only **one (labeled \"Site 7B\")** has a **blue lid and a handwritten \"CAUTION: IRRITANT FIBERS\" note**—distinguishing it from others with green/white lids. However, a **decorative blue glass paperweight on the desk** could confuse agents if not carefully inspected.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **GPS tracker (low battery)** needs recharging, but the **charging cable is missing**.  \n  - **Solution:** The cable is **inside the first aid kit (misplaced during an emergency)**, which itself requires **unlatching (stiff mechanism, needs two hands)**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis scene is **densely interactive**, with **embedded tasks requiring collaboration, tool use, and reasoning**. The **mix of scientific precision and field-station messiness** ensures realism, while the **Beaked Hazel research theme** drives unique interactions—agents might need to:  \n- **Collect and process nuts** (some requiring gloves due to irritant fibers).  \n- **Analyze rodent foraging patterns** (by tracking stolen caches).  \n- **Simulate controlled burns** (via the outdoor observation deck).  \n\nThe environment is **alive with potential**, where even **background objects (like the chewed pencil or dusty boots)** could hint at larger ecological puzzles."
