It's used by some systems to unmount filesystems, park drive heads and other useful stuff before the capacitors are drained after the power has been turned off.\n\nComment on Re: Most useless function.\nRe^2: Most useless function.\nby jdporter (Canon) on Feb 17, 2006 at 14:48 UTC\n\n    I really, really hope that story is apocryphal and wrong.\n    What, you're going to poll that status until it goes false?\n    Things like this should be event driven.\n\n    We're building the house of the future together.\n      AFAIK, there's also a signal that gets sent in event of a power fluctuation. From there, you can use \"ispoweron()\" to tell the difference between a momentary power blip, and a real outage condition.\n\n      You'll only bother to poll when you've got a signal that said there was a potential outage issue, and then only to check to see if the situation has resolved itself (power back on or not). Depending on that knowledge, you can implement a variety of recovery policies (shutdown immediately; wait 10 minutes, then shutdown if the power is still out; etc).\n\n      From what I remember, it's not a useless function; albeit rarely very useful, either. AFAIK, it's been implemented on one of the BSD varients (BSDI Unix, perhaps?)\n\n\n        Usually there is a non-maskable interrupt from a UPS that alerts the system to shut itself down while auxiliary power is working. Much would depend on the capacity of the UPS. Ideally you'll have time to flush buffers, close files, and clean up before the power dies completely.\n\nLog In?\n\nWhat's my password?\nCreate A New User\nNode Status?\nnode history\nNode Type: note [id://530839]\nand the web crawler heard nothing...\n\nHow do I use this? | Other CB clients\nOther Users?\nOthers about the Monastery: (11)\nAs of 2014-12-26 22:15 GMT\nFind Nodes?\n    Voting Booth?\n\n    Is guessing a good strategy for surviving in the IT business?\n\n    Results (176 votes), past polls\n",
  "response": "# **Data Center Emergency Shutdown Control Room**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-security data center control room during an unexpected power fluctuation event. The environment is a nexus of server management, emergency protocols, and backup power systems, requiring precise coordination between multiple technicians to prevent catastrophic data loss.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment:** Server racks, battery units, and emergency shut-off switches require multiple people to manipulate.  \n- **Distributed Information:** Critical status indicators, logs, and manuals are scattered across workstations and physical documents.  \n- **Timed Sequences:** Power failure protocols involve interdependent steps (flushing caches, unmounting drives, activating backups) that must be executed in parallel.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe control room is divided into four key zones:  \n\n1. **Main Monitoring Hub** – Central workstation cluster with live server diagnostics.  \n2. **Emergency Power Station** – Backup UPS units and manual override controls.  \n3. **Server Access Corridor** – Aisles between server racks with maintenance panels.  \n4. **Storage & Documentation Nook** – Shelves with physical manuals, spare parts, and toolkits.  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Monitoring Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A U-shaped workstation with **three 32-inch curved monitors** (displaying real-time power grid stability, server load, and temperature metrics).  \n- A **server status dashboard** (wall-mounted, lit by flickering LED strips).  \n- A **heavy-duty electrical panel** (secured with a magnetic lock, labeled \"MAIN FEED – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Admin Terminal** – A locked workstation requiring a **two-factor keycard + PIN**. The screen shows:  \n  - *\"CRITICAL: Power Fluctuation Detected – Auxiliary UPS Engaged (12 min estimated runtime).\"*  \n- **Emergency Shutdown Toggle** – A **red mushroom-button switch** under a protective glass cover (requires two simultaneous key turns to activate).  \n- **Logbook** – A **leather-bound binder** with last week’s maintenance notes (open to a page scribbled: *\"UPS #3 battery health: 72% – Monitor!\"*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Labeled Keycard Slots** – Three slots labeled \"PRIMARY\", \"SECONDARY\", and \"OVERRIDE.\"  \n- **Network Hub** – Blinking LEDs indicating active connections (one port labeled *\"Backup Sync – Do Not Disrupt\"*).  \n- **Cable Spool** – Partially unwound, with a **voltage tester** clipped to the side.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed \"Server Uptime Record\" Certificate** (showing *\"1,247 Days Without Incident\"*—now ironic).  \n- **Sticky Notes** on the edge of a monitor: *\"Jen – don’t forget the quarterly capacitor check!\"*  \n- **Half-empty Coffee Mug** (stained, with a chip on the rim) sitting atop a **stack of outdated thermal logs**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Emergency Power Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four industrial UPS units** (each **1.8m tall, 300kg**, with glowing capacity indicators).  \n- **Floor-mounted circuit breaker array** (heavy-duty switches, some labeled *\"CRITICAL LOAD\"*).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **UPS #3** – Its display flashes *\"WARNING: Battery Depletion in 8 min.\"*  \n- **Manual Override Lever** – Requires **two people to pull simultaneously** (due to a hydraulic resistance mechanism).  \n- **Battery Replacement Cart** – A **wheeled trolley** with fresh battery packs (**each 25kg, in sealed anti-static bags**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Voltage Stabilizer** – Humming loudly, with a flickering needle gauge.  \n- **Fire Extinguisher** – Mounted on the wall (**expiry sticker: 3 months overdue**).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Dusty \"Power Safety Procedures\" Poster** (partially peeling off).  \n- **Discarded Gloves** – Near a **half-assembled battery tester kit**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Server Access Corridor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four server racks** (each **2.2m tall, secured with latch locks**).  \n- **Overhead cable trays** (some wires dangling loosely).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Rack #2** – One drive bay blinks **red** (*\"Drive 14 – Fail Imminent\"*).  \n- **Maintenance Panel** – Contains a **manual drive head parking button** (behind a **screw-secured cover**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Crash Cart** – A **monitor-on-wheels** for direct server access.  \n- **Spare Hard Drives** – Stacked in a **static-free bin** (some labeled *\"Wiped – Tested\"*).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti** – Someone scribbled *\"Never trust UPS #3\"* on a rack.  \n- **Loose Screws** – Scattered near a **magnetic tray**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **D. Storage & Documentation Nook**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Metal Shelving Unit** – **Overloaded** with manuals (**\"Data Center Emergency Protocols v4.7\"**).  \n- **Locked Tool Cabinet** – Requires a **key hanging on a nearby hook**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Emergency Flashlight** – **Dead batteries** (test switch does nothing).  \n- **Spare Keycard** – Taped under the shelf (labeled *\"OVERRIDE – Break Glass\"*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label Maker** – Out of tape, with a **half-printed label** (*\"DO NOT—\"*).  \n- **Binder of Schematics** – Open to **\"UPS Wiring Diagram\"** (with coffee stains).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old Pizza Box** – Crushed under a **stack of outdated motherboards**.  \n- **\"Employee of the Month\" Photo** – **Faded, from 5 years ago**.  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **UPS Battery Replacement (300kg)** – Requires two people to align and slot into the rack.  \n- **Manual Override Lever** – Hydraulic resistance means **two agents must pull simultaneously**.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five keycards** (all look identical), only one has a **scratched RFID chip** and **\"OVERRIDE\"** etched in tiny letters.  \n- **Compound Tool Use:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **admin terminal is locked** (needs a keycard + PIN).  \n  - **Solution:** The **keycard is taped under a shelf**, and the **PIN is written in the logbook**.  \n\n### **Dynamic States & Problems:**  \n- **UPS #3 is failing** (8 min left).  \n- **Drive 14 in Rack #2 is about to fail** (needs manual parking).  \n- **Fire extinguisher is expired** (potential hazard).  \n\nThis dense environment ensures that agents must **collaborate, prioritize, and problem-solve under time pressure**. The clutter and background objects add **realistic noise**, forcing precise reasoning.  \n\n---  \n**Final Note:** Every object serves a purpose—whether functional, atmospheric, or as a potential task hook. The scene is now primed for complex, emergent AI behavior."
