You have to delete it or log out to make it go away. Conversely, whatever you type in the search field for the UGC search goes away if you change tabs on the very same window and you have to re-search for it. This is particularly strange. It would be nice if it was split in the middle of the two. As long as the window hasn't been closed, the search field should remain the way you have it. As soon as you close the window, it reverts to empty.\n\nAlso, it's nice that we can toggle between things that are completed and in progress in the accolades part of the journal, but could we also have the ability to close categories that we're not interested in seeing? I'm talking about the way the DOFF system works, where you can click on the category and it folds up and then click it again to drop it down.\n\nCould all the DOFF assignments that have a cool-down period be given a countdown clock? For instance, the newish ability to Exchange Officers apparently has a short cool-down period. It seems to be something like five minutes. But it would be nice to know that it's cooling down, rather than trying to run it again and finding that there's absolutely no one in your roster you can assign. Similarly, the DOFF contacts don't offer a cool-down time. They're just grayed out. Knowing when we're able to do something again is both convenient and important. Especially when you're trying to gain resources to allocate to a starbase.\n\nLastly, I'm sure that there's some sort of software development that is involved with this, but I'll ask anyway. Why is Earth the only planet from which we can choose to beam to orbit or to sector? I think, and I could be wrong about this, but I think that most of the people who are on a planet and then leave it are actually moving on to some other place entirely. Sitting through two load screens just to get back to sector space seems a little weird. Especially since we don't have to do it when we're leaving Earth.\n\n",

The depot is alive with activity: officers coordinate shipments, engineers troubleshoot malfunctioning replicators, and automated cargo drones zip overhead. The environment is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy Equipment**: Large components require multiple crew members to move.  \n- **Specialized Tools**: Many tasks demand precise tool selection.  \n- **Information Overload**: Displays, terminals, and physical labels must be cross-referenced.  \n\nThe scene is inspired by the **inconsistencies in UI behavior** from the original text—here translated into **physical inconsistencies in the depot's systems**, creating a need for problem-solving.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe depot is a **hexagonal modular station**, divided into interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Main Cargo Bay** – The central hub, stacked with crates awaiting dispatch. Overhead cranes hum, shifting heavy containers.  \n2. **Engineering Workshop** – A cluttered repair zone with half-disassembled equipment, diagnostic tools, and spare parts.  \n3. **Control Hub** – A ring of consoles monitoring depot operations, with flickering displays and a persistent error chime.  \n4. **Supply Storage** – A labyrinth of labeled shelves holding everything from plasma coils to ration packs.  \n5. **Officer Briefing Nook** – A small break area with a replicator (currently jammed) and outdated mission logs pinned to a board.  \n6. **Docking Airlock** – Where cargo drones enter/exit, with a stuck outer door sensor.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Cargo Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Cargo Crane (3-ton capacity)**: Overhead rail-mounted, currently holding a **1.8m x 1.2m duranium crate (sealed, \"CLASSIFIED – HANDLE WITH BIOHAZARD PROTOCOLS\")**.  \n- **Freight Pallet Stacker**: A wheeled hydraulic lift, parked near a pile of **20kg cargo pods**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Mislabeled Crate (1m³)**: Marked \"HYDROSPANNERS\" but rattles like liquid; requires scanning.  \n- **Stuck Conveyor Belt**: Jammed by a **bent stabilizing strut**, halting cargo flow.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Hand Scanner (on a charging dock)**: Shows 12% battery.  \n- **Cargo Manifest Terminal**: Display frozen on \"LOADING... 87%\".  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Starfleet Safety Poster**: \"REPORT MALFUNCTIONS TO ENGINEERING.\"  \n- **Dented Coffee Thermos**: Left on a crate, half-full of cold raktajino.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Engineering Workshop**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Workbench (reinforced steel)**: Scorched from recent plasma torch use.  \n- **Disabled Repair Drone**: Stuck in a corner, error light blinking.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Overloaded Power Distributor**: Requires recalibration (settings visibly misaligned).  \n- **Sealed Toolbox (biometric lock)**: Belongs to Chief Engineer R’vall, who is off-shift.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Plasma Spanner (partially disassembled)**: Missing its **flux coupler (last seen under the bench)**.  \n- **Diagnostic Pad**: Shows a looping error: \"COOLANT VALVE 3A OFFLINE.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti on Bulkhead**: \"NEVER TRUST THE REPLICATOR.\"  \n- **Pile of Outdated PADDs**: Covered in dust, one displaying a half-finished chess game.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Duranium Crate (1.8m x 1.2m, 320kg)**: Requires two agents—one to operate the crane, another to guide placement.  \n- **Stuck Airlock Door (jammed servo, 150kg resistance)**: Needs one agent to pry while another resets the hydraulic control.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning**: Among **five isolinear chips on the workbench**, only **one (with a red stripe and \"PRIORITY\" etched on it)** is the correct bypass module. The others are decoys (one is a burnt-out chip, another a data rod).  \n- **Compound Tool-Use**: To fix the **jammed replicator**, agents must:  \n  1. Retrieve the **hydrospanner (misplaced in the cargo bay)**.  \n  2. Use it to open the **replicator panel (stuck due to a warped latch)**.  \n  3. Replace the **fused power coupler (located in Supply Storage, behind expired ration boxes)**.  \n\n---  \n\nThis depot is **designed for chaos**—every inconsistency, misplaced tool, and malfunctioning system creates a web of potential tasks requiring **collaboration, precise reasoning, and tool improvisation**. The **background clutter** (like outdated PADDs and mislabeled crates) forces agents to filter signal from noise, mirroring the UI frustrations of the original text in a tangible, interactive world."
