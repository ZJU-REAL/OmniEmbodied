Here is a recent example of a user having problems with this.\n\nPutting an exact text input match to the top of the list is already implemented on the tag search page:\n\nalt text\n\nbut not in any autocomplete list.\n\nInteresting/ignored tags:\n\nalt text\n\nAsk Question/edit page:\n\nalt text\n\nTo make it easier to find short tags, I would like the same behaviour from the tag search page implemented in the autocomplete lists.\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the misunderstanding. I realize the autocomplete lists order descending by popularity and the search page orders by name. I think that part should stay the same. All I want is the exact match functionality added to the autocomplete lists.\n\nshare|improve this question\nI would like the exact tag match to be available on auto-complete as you request, but I'd prefer the rest of the behavior be kept the unchanged. Tag page is listed in something alphabetical, while the auto-complete is done by volume, and I think that the metric in the latter is useful for it. –  Grace Note Sep 10 '10 at 17:10\n@Grace: Good idea, but you can do both (keep shown items in popularity order plus show exact match) by bumping the last item if the exact match is lower. –  Gnome Sep 10 '10 at 19:35\n@Gnome That's exactly the solution I would like. –  Grace Note Sep 10 '10 at 19:42\nYeah, sorry guys. I've updated my post. @Grace –  Jon Seigel Sep 10 '10 at 21:43\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 2 down vote accepted\n\nFixed it up, will be deployed later today\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYou must log in to answer this question.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: The Forgotten Software Archive**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA sprawling, disorganized *software development archive* buried in the basement of an aging tech company. This is a relic of early 2000s software engineering—a maze of outdated servers, physical media, and forgotten documentation. The space is inherently collaborative due to its complexity: heavy equipment requires multiple people to move, obscure technical problems necessitate deep reasoning, and the sheer volume of legacy data means precise retrieval is essential.  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe archive is divided into **four key zones**, each with distinct challenges:  \n\n- **1. The Server Catacombs** – A dimly lit, high-ceilinged room lined with humming server racks. Some are powered down, others flicker with error LEDs.  \n- **2. The Media Vault** – A tightly packed storage area with labeled bins of CDs, floppy disks, and DAT tapes. Some are corrupted; others are pristine but unreadable without specialized hardware.  \n- **3. The Documentation Den** – A chaotic office space with overflowing filing cabinets, sticky notes, and an ancient printer that jams frequently.  \n- **4. The Workbench** – A central repair station with diagnostic tools, soldering irons, and a half-disassembled vintage computer.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **Zone 1: The Server Catacombs**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Three **2.5m-tall server racks**, each weighing ~400kg, mounted on locking casters.  \n- An **industrial UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** with a failing battery, leaking a faint chemical odor.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Legacy-7\" server** (status: overheating, fans at 100%, error code **E-45** on display).  \n- A **SATA-to-SCSI adapter** (required to access the Media Vault’s oldest drives).  \n- A **physical key** (rusted, unlabeled) hidden in a folded manual inside a drawer.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **rolling tool cart** (wrenches, thermal paste, spare RAM sticks).  \n- A **whiteboard** (scribbled with half-erased IP addresses).  \n- A **dusty CRT monitor** (flickering, connected to a diagnostics terminal).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Obsolete certifications** (framed, yellowed) on the walls.  \n- A **coffee cup** (stained, holding screws instead of liquid).  \n- A **broken office chair** (wheels missing, piled with old ethernet cables).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Zone 2: The Media Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty metal shelving units** (bolted to the floor, each shelf holds ~30kg of media).  \n- A **decommissioned tape robot arm** (jammed mid-motion, blocking access to Shelf C).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **DAT Tape #B-1029** (critical backup, but label partially torn—must cross-check with logs).  \n- A **CD spindle** (one disc is cracked; others have handwritten labels in fading ink).  \n- A **magnifying glass** (needed to read microscopic serial numbers).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **label printer** (out of tape, jammed).  \n- A **portable disk reader** (requires external power brick, which is missing).  \n- A **fireproof lockbox** (unlocked but empty).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated software boxes** (Windows 98, Photoshop 5.0).  \n- A **dead potted cactus** (used as a paperweight).  \n- A **\"Y2K Compliance\" poster** (peeling at the edges).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Zone 3: The Documentation Den**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **large oak desk** (one leg slightly shorter, wobbles).  \n- **Overstuffed filing cabinets** (drawers stick when pulled too quickly).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Server Manual Vol. 4** (missing pages 47-62, contains critical error codes).  \n- A **sticky note** (reads \"Password: T0pS3cr3t??\", stuck under keyboard).  \n- A **disassembled 3.5\" floppy drive** (needs repair to read Media Vault disks).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **dot-matrix printer** (out of paper, jammed).  \n- A **rotary phone** (no dial tone, cord tangled).  \n- A **stool with uneven legs** (tippy but functional).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed team photo** (from 2003, glass cracked).  \n- **Stacks of \"PC Magazine\"** (yellowed, some pages dog-eared).  \n- A **dusty Rubik’s Cube** (unsolved, placed on a monitor).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Zone 4: The Workbench**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **steel worktable** (scratched, stained with solder burns).  \n- A **magnifying lamp** (flickering bulb).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **vintage IBM PC** (missing its power supply, but the hard drive contains legacy data).  \n- A **soldering iron** (cold, needs to preheat before use).  \n- A **jumper wire kit** (some wires stripped, others intact).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **multimeter** (battery low, readings unreliable).  \n- A **parts organizer** (some compartments empty, others full of resistors).  \n- A **broken oscilloscope** (display shows static).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **\"No Food or Drink\" sign** (ignored; soda can ring stains nearby).  \n- A **stack of old Motherboard boxes** (used as makeshift shelves).  \n- A **desk fan** (one blade bent, wobbles when turned on).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- The **server racks (400kg each)** require at least two people to move safely.  \n- The **jammed tape robot arm** blocks access to Shelf C—one agent must hold it steady while another retrieves the media.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five identical-looking DAT tapes**, only one has a **faint red dot** near its label—this is the uncorrupted backup.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The vintage PC won’t boot (missing power supply).  \n  - **Solution:** The **UPS in the Server Catacombs** has a compatible adapter, but its battery must be stabilized first.  \n\n#### **Perceptual Distractors (Purposeful Noise):**  \n- The **multiple unlabeled keys** (one opens the fireproof lockbox; another is useless).  \n- The **similar-looking CDs** (some are blank, others contain data, but labels have faded differently).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**  \nThis scene is **dense with intentional interactivity**—every object has properties that could matter in a task, while background clutter forces sharper observation. The space **demands collaboration** (heavy lifting, simultaneous actions) and **deep reasoning** (obscure errors, hidden dependencies). Agents must navigate **physical constraints** (jammed doors, failing equipment) and **information gaps** (missing manuals, corrupted labels).  \n\n**This is a stage where complex, multi-agent problem-solving isn’t just possible—it’s necessary.**"
