LOVE 'em. My MacBook Pro 15\" has two drives, one is the 750GB Momentus hybrid, and the other is a slow 1TB HD. What I really want is two 1TB hybrids. This seems to be achievable much sooner than with SSD, and the speed is \"good enough\".\n\nBeyond just going to 1TB, the other thing Seagate could do is go with massively increasing the SSD portion, and making it a full volume instead of cache, say, 128GB or more, and then allowing us to use that as a boot/app volume.\n\nThis seems physically possible today, but would add a couple hundred dollars or so...but would be totally worth it.\n\nI see hybrids becoming even more valuable in the future as the SSD portion can grow to become even more useful before SSD-only becomes available at reasonable prices in the capacities we need.\n\n(For the love of God, please don't reply to this comment with the word \"cloud\" anywhere in the post... we're talking TBs here)\n\nComment: Travel!!

This won't work for all jobs, but a couple of years ago I found myself in this situation. My \"office\" is my MacBook and my iPhone. I did a couple of Eurail trips and it works great being able to work, even on the train. I've had a few other trips as well, and it's a really cool thing, as long as you can get the work done, and stay up late to do so if needed.\n\nComment: Re:Context?

The product takes off and then when the new version of the product comes out you say, \"it's a disappointing update, nothing new\". All the while you talk about \"lack of real innovation\". Meanwhile from the iPod to the iPad, we've seen overwhelming success after success, including not only new products, but updates to products as well.\n\nDon't expect 5 years from now that the iPad is going to be significantly different from the original iPad...thin, display, touch, about 10\", glass, etc... There's only so much you can, or more importantly *should*, do with that. However, do expect it to be selling well, and to be getting very high marks in customer satisfaction.\n\nComment: Re:Context?

Really, given the growth rate of Apple, I don't see how the shares could come back down any time soon, unless there's some major end-of-world-like catastrophe.\n\n\"My best estimate is that Apple shares should be priced around $130-$150/share\"\n\nWhat the hell is your estimate based on? The P/E ratio is already about average for the market if going by TTM (trailing 12 months), which is flawed since Apple's business has been doubling every year. Still, be conservative and go by TTM and Apple is right where it should be.\n\nYour estimate of $130 a share, even with a conservative TTM approach, gives it a P/E ratio of 3.5! It gives it a market cap of $117 Billion, which is just about what their cash on hand will be at the end of next quarter.\n\nForgetting the cash on hand, you're still estimating Apple's market value to be *less* than the projected revenue for the year...not smart for a company with a profit margin that's over 25%.\n\n\"If I had the cash to short Apple stock over the long term, I would do that.\"\n\nI wonder why you don't have the cash. /s\n\nLook, we get it, you're an anti-apple fanboy, but you're better off sticking to the one-button mice comments.\n\nComment: Re:In Harm's Way (Score 3, Funny) 166\n\nby macslut (#39245511) Attached to: Did the Titanic Sink Due To an Optical Illusion?\n\nWell there's that and only 2 other things that make up every submarine movie ever made.\n\nSpoiler alert: here are all 3:\n1) Sealing of bulkheads with \"good\" men on the other side.

If you're using your iPhone independent of your car system, 1) you're doing it wrong, and 2) Siri won't work with the music cranked up.\n\nComment: Re:Random troll (Score 1) 356\n\nby macslut (#38531966) Attached to: Ask Slashdot: Best Android Tablet For Travel?\n\"To travel. To experience new things, new people, new places. Not to fuck around with a gadget\" I totally disagree. A couple of years ago, I started a business that allows me to work anywhere as long as I can connect. I've taken several trips, and travel with an iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and a couple of 1TB Passport drives. The tech gives me the freedom to travel, and carrying it with me avoids the need to \"return home because there's a problem...\" or spend hours on the phone talking someone through something. One trip, I spent 24 days going throughout Europe with nothing but a backpack...which was mostly filled with my tech. The additional thing about it, in terms of experiencing where you are, is that the tech provides incredible resources, from GPS navigation, wikipedia'ing all kinds of information about the things around you, and changing reservations on the fly. And yes, sometimes when you travel, there is downtime, and the tech can not only entertain you, but others as well. On a bus in the middle of night going from Marrakesh to Agadir, I showed *Glee* on the iPad... that was pretty surreal and unforgettable. I don't have much advice to offer in terms of Android tablets... I can say that I used a Chromebook and absolutely hated it, so go with a tablet or a real notebook.\n\nComment: Not just apps (Score 1) 523\n\nby macslut (#38519812) Attached to: Why We Agonize Over Buying $1 Apps\nI know a lot of people with a lot of money, and it cracks me up when I find them agonizing over price differences for things that are relatively insignificant to them. Why would you consume *any* time whatsoever over a trivial amount of money? For me, $1 for an app is definitely below the threshold of consideration. However, having yet another app littering my library, is a problem. I currently have 544 apps for my iPhone and iPad consuming 25GB. That's friggin' ridiculous... what's wrong with me? And this is after I purged my library a few months ago of unwanted apps. Anyway, now I look closer at the ratings and descriptions to see if it's really going to be worth adding the app to my library, as opposed to just the cost. I'm much more likely to go with the better app, than the cheaper.\n\nComment: Re:Wow, when you can't trust CNET (Score 1) 397\n\nby macslut (#37174550) Attached to: Now Wraps Downloads In Bloatware\nQuickTime doesn't require you to allow it to take control of any extensions. I'm not a big fan of bundled apps, but at some point people are just being cry babies about this. It's worth noting that iTunes uses QuickTime for more than just video. Audio is being driving through QuickTime as well. As sglewis said, WebKit is in iTunes as well, and nobody complains about that. Perhaps that's what Apple should have done to silence the whiners, just *hide* QuickTime inside iTunes with no option to remove it or run independently.\n\nComment: Re:Start your betting (Score 2) 413\n\nby macslut (#34894054) Attached to: Google To Push WebM With IE9, Safari Plugins\n\"Not that Apple wouldn't be inclined to try it, of course, along with some blathering public statement along the lines of \"in order to protect the user experience, we have decided to disallow the use of Google's proprietary video formats on our operating system...\"\n\nThey already did.

  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"The Nomadic Tech Workshop\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA compact, mobile tech repair and development workshop housed within a refurbished shipping container, designed for a traveling digital nomad who operates from remote locations. The space is densely packed with gear for hardware tinkering, data recovery, and software development—optimized for portability but requiring careful coordination to utilize effectively.  \n\nThe scene inherently supports multi-agent collaboration due to:  \n- **Tight Space Constraints:** Many tools and devices are heavy or awkwardly positioned, requiring teamwork to move or access.  \n- **Modular Workstations:** Different zones serve distinct purposes (repair, testing, storage), necessitating coordination between agents to complete workflows.  \n- **Precise Tool & Data Management:** Critical components are stored in labeled but cluttered containers, demanding careful retrieval.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe shipping container is divided into four key zones:  \n\n1. **Main Workbench (Front Section)**  \n   - A fold-out aluminum worktable with magnetic tool strips, cluttered with half-disassembled laptops, soldering stations, and diagnostic equipment.  \n   - Overhead LED strip lighting flickers intermittently.  \n\n2. **Storage & Supply Bay (Left Wall)**  \n   - Floor-to-ceiling pegboards with labeled bins for screws, cables, and chips.  \n   - A stack of Pelican cases containing sensitive backup drives.  \n\n3. **Testing & Debugging Station (Rear Section)**  \n   - A small desk with multiple monitors, an industrial fan (missing two blades), and a tangled nest of USB hubs.  \n   - A thermal testing rig for SSDs, humming softly.  \n\n4. **Sleeping & Personal Nook (Right Wall)**  \n   - A fold-down cot with a rumpled sleeping bag.  \n   - A miniature shelf with travel hygiene items and a dog-eared paperback copy of *Neuromancer*.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Workbench**  \n**Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A reinforced **hydraulic worktable** (weight: 85kg; dimensions: 120x60cm), locked in a half-extended position due to a stuck lever.  \n- A **wall-mounted tool rack** with a missing screwdriver slot.  \n\n**Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **Seagate Momentus 750GB hybrid drive** (disassembled, exposing the SSD cache module).  \n- A **semi-functional logic analyzer** (display flickers; requires calibration).  \n- A **locked anti-static parts cabinet** (key missing).  \n\n**Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **USB microscope** (focus knob stiff).  \n- A **coffee-stained schematic** for a custom RAID controller.  \n- A **3D-printed bracket** (slightly warped).  \n\n**Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **peeling \"Tech Support Zen\" poster**.  \n- A **stack of outdated MacWorld magazines**.  \n- A **dusty Rubik’s Cube with two missing stickers**.  \n\n### **B. Storage & Supply Bay**  \n**Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **floor-mounted server rack** (partially collapsed; one rail bent).  \n- A **heavy-duty shelving unit** (weight capacity: 200kg; currently overloaded).  \n\n**Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **Seagate 1TB backup drive** (encrypted; recovery key written on a sticky note buried under clutter).  \n- A **mismatched set of Torx screwdrivers** (T5 missing).  \n\n**Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **bin of assorted SATA cables** (some frayed).  \n- A **leaking capacitor disposal bin** (warning label peeling).  \n\n**Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **faded \"I ❤️ Slashdot\" bumper sticker**.  \n- A **broken mechanical keyboard (Cherry MX Blues)**.  \n\n### **C. Testing & Debugging Station**  \n**Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **wheeled office chair** (one caster jammed).  \n- A **three-monitor arm setup** (middle monitor has a dead pixel).  \n\n**Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **custom-built SSD stress-tester** (overheating; thermal paste dried out).  \n- A **Bluetooth debugging dongle** (firmware corrupted).  \n\n**Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **half-empty bottle of isopropyl alcohol**.  \n- A **stack of burnt CD-Rs labeled \"ARCHIVE - DO NOT TOUCH\"**.  \n\n**Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **screensaver showing a rotating BSD daemon**.  \n- A **dusty \"Hack the Planet!\" mug**.  \n\n### **D. Sleeping & Personal Nook**  \n**Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **fold-out cot** (one hinge squeaks loudly).  \n- A **mini-fridge** (intermittent compressor whine).  \n\n**Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **passport wedged under the mattress**.  \n- A **partially encrypted travel journal**.  \n\n**Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **portable battery bank** (70% charge).  \n- A **wrinkled train ticket to Berlin**.  \n\n**Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **smashed GoPro case**.  \n- A **dried-out potted cactus**.  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Bent Server Rack Rail (Storage Bay)** – Requires two agents to stabilize while a third attempts to hammer it back into alignment.  \n- **Hydraulic Worktable (Main Bench)** – Needs synchronized force to unjam the lever while preventing it from collapsing.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five identical **anti-static bags** in the parts cabinet, only **one** contains the **Seagate SSD cache module** (distinguished by a tiny Sharpie mark reading \"X230\").  \n  - The **encrypted 1TB backup drive** has its recovery key on a **yellow sticky note** buried under **junk mail**—forcing agents to sift through clutter.  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - To **fix the logic analyzer**, agents must:  \n    1. **Find the missing T5 screwdriver** (in a bin under old magazines).  \n    2. **Unlock the anti-static cabinet** (key hidden inside the **Rubik’s Cube**).  \n    3. **Replace a blown capacitor** (requires the **USB microscope** to inspect).  \n\n### **Atmospheric & Noise Elements for Realism:**  \n- **A loose cable occasionally sparks** near the testing rig (harmless but distracting).  \n- **The mini-fridge hums irregularly**, masking faint electronic beeps.  \n\nThis environment is **ripe for multi-agent problem-solving**, blending physical coordination, logical deduction, and tool-based repair in a chaotic but plausible workspace."
