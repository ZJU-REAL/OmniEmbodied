One couldn't escape sensing that watching Rachel Maddow's show last night. Not only did Maddow express her own grievances, but Newsweek's venerable gumshoe Michael Isikoff reported on a meeting between Obama and liberal supporters that went completely off the rails.\n\nAccording to Isikoff, there was a \"secret meeting\" held at the White House yesterday to discuss Obama's treatment of the whole torture issue. Attending the meeting were the leaders of various unnamed human rights and civil liberties groups, as well as many key Obama administration officials—-Eric Holder, Rahm Emanuel, David Axelrod—-which sort of indicated how serious the Obama people were taking it. The purpose of the meeting seems pretty clear—-Obama and company, according to Isikoff, reached out to the leaders of the various groups present and basically said, \"Ok, what do we need to do to make you people happy so this will all go away.\" In fact, Isikoff quoted Obama as saying something along the lines of \"(Attorney General) Holder is having to spend way too much time on this.\" The leaders of the groups present floated the idea that Obama should appoint some sort of \"truth commission\" to investigate everything fully, thereby taking the burden off of Holder and the Justice Department, but Obama shot that idea down, going on to say that he was \"firmly against\" any sort of investigatory committee. Another idea floated by the groups was for Obama to go after one key prosecution in the case (Dick Cheney perhaps?) in the hopes of obtaining \"a trophy,\" a head for the troops to rally around, but Obama shot that idea down as well. At one point, one of the group leaders took a shot at Obama, saying that he was \"allowing President Bush's policies to become his own.\" According to Isikoff, this pissed Obama off greatly, to the point where he was visibly shaken by the comment, \"demonstrably not pleased\" according to Maddow.\n\nIt should be noted that Maddow asked Isikoff how it was that he came to know the details of the \"secret meeting\" to which he responded, \"it's called reporting.\" We love that guy.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Crisis Resolution War Room\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThis is a high-stakes **White House Emergency Coordination Room**, repurposed as a clandestine meeting space for a tense negotiation between administration officials and external advocacy groups. The room is designed for **multi-agent collaboration** with an atmosphere of urgency, secrecy, and political friction.  \n\n- **Why Multi-Agent?** The room is structured to require:  \n  - **Simultaneous document handling** (classified files, legal briefs, protest materials).  \n  - **Physical coordination** (moving heavy evidence boxes, operating secure AV systems).  \n  - **Information control** (monitoring live feeds, shredding sensitive documents, managing digital leaks).  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe **Crisis Resolution War Room** is a **soundproofed, windowless chamber** with reinforced doors, divided into three functional zones:  \n\n1. **Negotiation Hub** – Central conference area with a **7-seat mahogany table**, surrounded by high-backed leather chairs.  \n2. **Document Processing Station** – A **wall of locked filing cabinets**, a **heavy-duty industrial shredder**, and a **large evidence cart** stacked with sealed boxes.  \n3. **AV & Surveillance Corner** – A **live news feed monitor wall**, a **secure telephone line**, and a **classified document scanner**.  \n\n#### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n##### **A. Negotiation Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Mahogany conference table (3m x 1.5m, 280kg)** – Requires **two agents** to move.  \n- **Leather executive chairs (each 25kg, wheeled but locked in place)** – One is **slightly scuffed** from a recent angry push-back.  \n- **Wall-mounted analog clock (non-functional, stuck at 11:47)** – A relic from past crises.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Five manila folders** – Each labeled with **\"EYES ONLY\"** and a different advocacy group’s name.  \n- **A single USB drive (marked \"TRUTH COMMISSION DRAFT\")** – Left deliberately on the table near the President’s seat.  \n- **A half-empty glass of water (condensation rings staining a legal pad beneath)** – Indicates a long, heated discussion.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A landline phone with a direct line to the AG’s office (status: off-hook, faint dial tone).**  \n- **A digital recorder (status: paused, 47 minutes of runtime logged).**  \n- **A wheeled whiteboard (partially erased, remnants of a bullet-point list: \"1. No commissions, 2. No prosecutions, 3. Contain fallout\").**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed portrait of Lincoln (dusty, slightly askew).**  \n- **A forgotten coffee cup (stained, lipstick mark on the rim).**  \n- **Scattered paperclips and a bent staple near the shredder.**  \n\n---  \n\n##### **B. Document Processing Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four-drawer steel filing cabinet (500kg, bolted to the floor, drawers 1 & 3 locked).**  \n- **Industrial shredder (60kg, capacity: 20 sheets, status: jammed with a crumpled memo stuck halfway).**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"EVIDENCE BOX 12A\" (sealed with red tape, weight: 30kg, requires two agents).**  \n- **A binder labeled \"INTERROGATION TRANSCRIPTS (2002-2008)\" (pages dog-eared, Post-it tabs marking key sections).**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A label printer (out of tape, blinking red error light).**  \n- **A cart with **three empty banker’s boxes (one has a cracked corner).**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A faded \"TOP SECRET\" poster peeling off the wall.**  \n- **A dead potted fern in the corner.**  \n- **A sticky note on the cabinet: \"DO NOT SHRED - HOLDER ONLY\".**  \n\n---  \n\n##### **C. AV & Surveillance Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **55-inch LCD news feed monitor (live MSNBC broadcast frozen on Rachel Maddow’s face).**  \n- **Secure fax machine (status: out of paper, error light blinking).**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A briefcase (combination-locked, weight: 12kg, slight hum from an unknown device inside).**  \n- **A Dictaphone with a **partially recorded message:** *\"...if this leaks, we’re finished—\"***  \n\n**c.

Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A stack of outdated Congressional Records (dusty, unused).**  \n- **A half-peeled \"SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED\" sticker on the door.**  \n\n---  \n\n#### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n##### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **EVIDENCE BOX 12A (30kg, bulky dimensions)** – Requires **two agents** to lift safely.  \n- **Mahogany table (280kg, 3m long)** – Could be **barricaded** against the door in an emergency.  \n\n##### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Five **\"EYES ONLY\" folders** – Only **one** has a **coffee stain** and **handwritten margin notes** (identifies the most contentious group).  \n  - Among **three USBs** in the room, only **one** has a **scratched-off label** (the real \"TRUTH COMMISSION\" draft).  \n- **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The shredder is **jammed**.  \n  - **Solution:** A **letter opener** (on the conference table) can pry out the stuck paper.  \n  - **Additional Challenge:** The **scanned memo** must be **cross-checked** against a **physical logbook** (in the filing cabinet).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis scene is **dense with interactive objects**, layered **visual and auditory cues**, and **deliberate red herrings** (like the humming briefcase) that force agents to **prioritize, collaborate, and problem-solve under pressure**. The **political tension is palpable** in every misplaced document and interrupted recording, making it ideal for **complex negotiation, crisis management, and covert teamwork tasks**."
