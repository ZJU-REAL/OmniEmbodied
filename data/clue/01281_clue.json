All events have occurred on airplanes that were recently routed through western United States airports,\" Boeing's message to airlines said. \"The investigation has narrowed the leading root cause to intermittent fuel contamination.\"\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the pilot returned to the airport.\n\n\n\n\"We've increased the focus on it since last year,\" he said.\n\n\n\"The engine, the fuel control unit, the fuel, it's all part of a system,\" said Tull. \"We're looking at the whole system.\"\n\n\"These are extremely rare events, but clearly we don't want one to happen again,\" Tull added. \"We're focused on finding a fix.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the period when Alaska Airlines experienced its 17 incidents--between Jan. 1, 2008, and Nov. 30, 2012 -- the airline flew 737s on 378,674 flights.\n\nThat's less than one incident per 23,000 flights.\n\n\n\n\nBoeing's message said it is working closely on the problem with \"the fuel supply chain\" and has notified the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIn such situations where a large number of airplanes are potentially affected, the FAA typically follows up with an airworthiness directive to make any Boeing recommendations mandatory.\n",
  "response": "# **Aircraft Maintenance Hangar: Fuel Contamination Investigation Scene**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nAn expansive aircraft maintenance hangar at a major western U.S. airport, bustling with activity as engineers and technicians diagnose a series of unexplained engine oscillations linked to suspected fuel contamination. The scene is inherently collaborative, requiring teams to work together under tight deadlines—inspecting fuel systems, testing samples, and cross-referencing maintenance logs—while adhering to strict aviation safety protocols. The environment is dense with specialized tools, diagnostic equipment, and partially disassembled engine components, demanding precise coordination between personnel.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe hangar is divided into several functional zones:  \n\n- **Maintenance Bay (Primary Workspace):** A Boeing 737 is parked here, partially disassembled, with its left engine cowling removed and fuel lines exposed. The area is cluttered with hydraulic lifts, tool carts, and diagnostic rigs.  \n- **Fuel Analysis Lab (Adjacent Room):** A compact but well-equipped lab where engineers test fuel samples for contaminants.  \n- **Parts & Logistics Storage:** A high-rack storage area for spare components, fuel filters, and sealed containers of aviation-grade lubricants.  \n- **Operations Control Desk:** A cluttered workstation with flight logs, maintenance records, and real-time telemetry feeds from the aircraft.  \n- **Break Area (Secondary Space):** A small lounge with a coffee maker, lockers, and a bulletin board covered in safety notices.  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **Maintenance Bay**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Hydraulic Maintenance Lift (3000kg capacity, currently raised to 2m height, supporting the 737’s left engine nacelle).**  \n- **Engine Support Rig (a reinforced steel frame with adjustable clamps, currently stabilizing the dismounted high-pressure fuel pump).**  \n- **Tool Chest Rack (a rolling 5-drawer unit filled with aviation-grade wrenches, torque meters, and inspection mirrors).**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Contaminated Fuel Sample (in a sealed 1L glass cylinder, labeled \"Flight #AL487 / 11-12-2024 / Suspect Batch\").**  \n- **Fuel Control Unit (FCU) (partially disassembled, with an exposed diaphragm showing slight discoloration).**  \n- **Digital Oscillation Analyzer (a handheld device displaying erratic pressure spikes, currently plugged into the engine’s diagnostic port).**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Portable Work Light (LED, 2000 lumens, mounted on a flexible arm, casting sharp shadows).**  \n- **Fire Extinguisher (10kg CO2 type, mounted on a bright red bracket near the engine).**  \n- **Parts Cleaning Station (ultrasonic tank filled with degreaser, currently idle).**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Faded \"No Smoking\" decal (peeling slightly near the hangar door).**  \n- **Stack of Old Maintenance Manuals (dog-eared, with coffee stains on the topmost binder).**  \n- **Dirty Rag (discarded on a nearby stool, smeared with grease).**  \n\n---  \n\n### **Fuel Analysis Lab**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Gas Chromatograph (bench-mounted, currently running a sample analysis, emitting a low hum).**  \n- **Fume Hood (stainless steel, with a half-open sliding glass panel).**  \n- **Microscope Workstation (adjustable LED ring light, 400x magnification).**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Contaminant Reference Chart (a laminated sheet taped to the wall, listing known fuel adulterants).**  \n- **Fuel Filter Array (five used filters labeled by flight number, one with visible particulate buildup).**  \n- **Calibration Weights (set of precision brass weights, stored in a foam-lined case).**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Lab Scale (digital, 0.001g precision, currently displaying \"0.000\").**  \n- **Safety Goggles (hanging on a pegboard, slightly scratched).**  \n- **Sealed Glovebox (argon-purged, unused but ready).**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **\"Days Since Last Incident\" Counter (whiteboard, reading \"143\").**  \n- **Sticky Notes (handwritten reminders like \"Check GC calibration!\").**  \n- **Dead Potted Plant (a dried-out succulent in a chipped ceramic pot).**  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The dismounted high-pressure fuel pump (weighing 85kg, awkwardly shaped) requires two technicians to safely maneuver onto the inspection rig.**  \n- **A fuel drum (200L capacity, full weight ~160kg) must be rolled from storage to the lab, necessitating coordination due to its bulk and hazardous contents.**  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among five fuel filters, only one has a **blue inspection tag**, **unusual crystalline deposits**, and a **handwritten \"DO NOT DISCARD\" note**—requiring careful distinction from otherwise identical filters.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The fuel control unit (FCU) is locked in an error state due to a suspected firmware bug.  \n  - **Solution:** The override key is stored in the **Operations Control Desk (third drawer, under a stack of flight logs)**, requiring cross-room navigation and verification of access permissions.  \n\n### **Environmental \"Noise\" as Cognitive Challenge**  \n- The **decoy blue-tagged chemical bottle in the lab** (containing harmless cleaning solution) could mislead an inattentive agent into confusing it with the critical fuel sample.  \n- The **flickering LED work light** introduces intermittent visual uncertainty when reading fine instrument dials.  \n\n---  \n\nThis scene is designed to force **multi-agent collaboration** (heavy lifting, simultaneous diagnostics), **precision reasoning** (filter identification, contaminant tracing), and **dynamic problem-solving** (tool retrieval, system overrides). The density of interactive objects, layered states, and ambient distractions ensures that agents must operate with real-world precision and adaptability."
