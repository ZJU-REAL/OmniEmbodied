It goes back at least to Robert A. Taft in 1952, and has been represented in more recent years by Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Pat Buchanan in 1992.\n\nDemocrats may have their own tradition of ideological diehards -- the Henry Wallace, George McGovern wing of the party -- but the breed seems to have lessened in recent years. Or at least had their energy drained away in futile third-party efforts like Ralph Nader's that assure a Republican victory. But there is still a wing of Republicanism that would much prefer to recite its favorite shibboleths than win a mere presidential election. Ideologues tend to embrace defeat as proof of their authenticity.\n\nWhittaker Chambers famously compared such types to an old man in a dark shop who never sells anything but spends his time \"fingering for his own pleasure, some oddments of cloth. Nobody wants to buy them, which is fine because the old man is not really interested in selling. He just likes to hold and to feel.\"\n\nIn this year's GOP primaries, Ron Paul is the designated Old Man in a Dark Shop, but the role keeps getting re-assigned as the familiar scenario is played out with a different cast every four years or so. This year others keep trying out for the part -- Michele Bachman, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum. ... Mitt Romney's great advantage is that he's the solid, well-organized businessman in the race. His great disadvantage is that he's the solid, well-organized businessman in the race.\n\nMitt Romney's candidacy raises a by-now familiar question for Republicans: Can a candidate without charisma but only experience, perseverance, a working knowledge of the issues and other dull-as-duty virtues compete with the ideological and rhetorical dazzle of rivals who appeal to the party's true believers? Super Tuesday may tell us. Or it may just prolong the agony.\n\nIt's a familiar danger for a party -- or a country -- based on ideas: In rash hands, ideas become only ideology. And the lunatic fringe becomes the warp-and-woof of a party. Unless tempered by experience, moderated by tradition, tested in the real world, the best of ideas may become the worst of ideologies.\n\nRepublicans always seem to be waiting for another Reagan, a leader who can combine the spellbinding appeal of an actor who thrills the crowd with the practical political skills acquired over a long career of practical leadership. Admirers of The Gipper may forget that he was not just a star but also a union leader, governor and president who knew how to compromise when he needed to.\n\nBut the Reagans of political life, like the FDRs, are rare. This year, Republicans might as well wait for Godot, the character who never arrives in a play that never goes anywhere. Such may or may not be the stuff of art, but it's not the stuff of politics, the art of the possible. Certainly not this year, a year in which Americans have to choose between the candidates we've got, not the mythic figures their campaigns depict.\n\nPaul Greenberg\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Political Backroom – A Campaign War Room Frozen in Time\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nInspired by the political strategizing and ideological struggles described in the text, this scene is a **cluttered, high-stakes campaign war room**—once the nerve center of a failed political bid. The environment is rich with collaborative potential, as teams of agents must sift through the remnants of a fractured campaign, uncovering hidden plans, salvaging useful data, and piecing together what went wrong.  \n\nThe room is **dense with documents, outdated tech, and half-finished strategies**, creating an inherently collaborative space where agents must:  \n- **Coordinate** to move heavy objects (filing cabinets, AV equipment).  \n- **Decipher** layered information (cross-referencing notes, whiteboards, and digital files).  \n- **Repurpose** abandoned tools (broken printers, disconnected servers) for new tasks.  \n\nThe atmosphere is one of **abandoned urgency**—coffee cups left half-full, whiteboards smudged from frantic erasures, and a lingering tension of a team that left in disarray.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe war room is a **medium-sized office space divided into functional zones**:  \n\n1. **Main Strategy Table** – A large, oval table cluttered with maps, sticky notes, and a projector. The focal point of past late-night planning sessions.  \n2. **Media & Communications Corner** – A cluster of monitors, recording equipment, and tangled cables where press statements were drafted.  \n3. **Research & Archives** – Overstuffed filing cabinets, a scanner, and a wall of reference books with dog-eared pages.  \n4. **Break Area** – A small kitchenette with a coffee maker, mini-fridge, and a bulletin board covered in outdated memos.  \n5. **Candidate’s Private Nook** – A semi-secluded desk with a locked drawer, personal memorabilia, and a disconnected landline phone.  \n\nEach area is **interconnected**, forcing agents to move between zones to complete tasks (e.g., retrieving a document from archives to cross-check a whiteboard claim).  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Strategy Table**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **12-person oval table** (3m x 2m, laminate surface, stained with coffee rings).  \n- A **ceiling-mounted projector** (functional but overheating after prolonged use).  \n- A **wheeled whiteboard** (1.8m x 1.2m, covered in half-erased strategy notes in blue/red marker).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **tactical campaign map** (large paper sheet, pinned to the table, marked with colored pushpins—some loose on the floor).  \n- A **sealed manila envelope** (labelled \"CONFIDENTIAL – POLLING DATA, DO NOT DISCARD\").  \n- A **broken label maker** (out of tape, jammed mechanism—requires two people to disassemble).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Scattered highlighters** (dried out, except for one green one).  \n- **A wireless keyboard** (low battery, keys sticking).  \n- **A half-empty water cooler** (needs a new 5-gallon jug, stored near the break area).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A motivational poster** (\"TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK\") peeling at one corner.  \n- **A forgotten suit jacket** draped over a chair (pocket contains a crumpled speech draft).  \n- **A digital wall clock** (stuck at 3:47 PM, battery dead).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Media & Communications Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **6-monitor news wall** (one screen flickering, HDMI cables dangling).  \n- A **soundproof recording booth** (door slightly ajar, mic stand unsecured).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **malfunctioning teleprompter** (requires two people to lift and reposition).  \n- A **USB drive** (hidden under the keyboard, labeled \"BACKUP – RON PAUL RESPONSE\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **printer** (toner low, paper tray jammed).  \n- A **stack of press badges** (some blank, some with outdated event dates).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A coffee stain** shaped like Florida on the carpet.  \n- **A framed photo** of the candidate shaking hands with a local mayor (glass cracked).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Research & Archives**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four steel filing cabinets** (one drawer stuck, requires two agents to pry open).  \n- A **document scanner** (power cord frayed, needs replacement).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **leather-bound binder** (\"DONOR LIST – MASTER COPY\") locked with a small combination lock.  \n- A **box of shredded documents** (some pieces salvageable if cross-referenced with digital backups).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **magnifying glass** (left on top of a stack of newspapers).  \n- A **staple remover** (rusted, barely functional).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A potted fern** (wilting, soil dry).  \n- **A vintage \"I Like Ike\" button** (discarded in a drawer).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The stuck filing cabinet** (weighs ~120kg when full; requires two agents to tilt and unjam).  \n- **The teleprompter** (awkward shape, 2m tall—needs coordinated lifting).  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five **USB drives** on the media desk, only one has a **red casing and a small scratch**—this contains the critical opposition research.  \n  - **Distractor:** Other USBs contain mundane files (vacation photos, old spreadsheets).  \n- **Compound Tool-Use Problem:**  \n  - **Problem:** The donor binder is locked (combination unknown).  \n  - **Solution:** The code is written on a **Post-it note stuck under the candidate’s desk**, but retrieving it requires moving a heavy chair.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Atmosphere Notes**  \n- **Flickering fluorescent lights** create intermittent shadows.  \n- The **hum of an old server** in the corner provides constant background noise.  \n- A **lingering smell of stale coffee and printer toner** reinforces the \"abandoned in haste\" vibe.  \n\nThis scene is **ripe for emergent collaboration**—agents must **communicate, delegate, and problem-solve** to navigate the chaotic aftermath of a failed campaign."
