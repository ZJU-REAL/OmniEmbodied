Caching full-page and partial-page to avoid hitting the appserver: nginx\n  2. Profiling, profiling, profiling. Whatever language you use to develop your app, profile the major requests to make sure you're being efficient. Tracking which requests take too much time will allow you to narrow down what to profile.\n  3. Profile the database with real users' usage. Keep the DBA's doing their job after the users get their hands on it.\n  4. Profile your HTML/CSS/JavaScript to ensure it is as small as possible, and that there are as few requests back to the server as possible: YSlow, Minify JavaScript\n  5. If the websites are really that important, don't forget to be fault-tolerant. This often helps with speed, too.\nshare|improve this answer\n\nOpcode cache for PHP.

  "response": "# **Data Center Control Room: The Nerve Center of a Scalable Web Infrastructure**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThis scene is a **24/7 operational data center control room**, the beating heart of a high-traffic web service. The room hums with activity as technicians, engineers, and automated systems work in concert to maintain uptime, optimize performance, and troubleshoot issues in real time.  \n\nThe environment is **inherently collaborative**—critical tasks require coordination between multiple agents due to:  \n- **Heavy or unwieldy hardware** (server racks, backup power units) that require team lifting.  \n- **Simultaneous monitoring** of multiple dashboards and logs to diagnose cascading failures.  \n- **Distributed problem-solving**, where one agent may need to retrieve a tool while another reboots a server.  \n\nThe room is dense with **interconnected systems**, **precise documentation**, and **hidden dependencies**, making it ideal for complex multi-agent reasoning.  \n\n---  \n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe control room is divided into **four functional zones**, each with its own purpose and challenges:  \n\n1. **Main Monitoring Hub** – The central workstation with multiple displays tracking server health, network traffic, and cache efficiency.  \n2. **Rack Maintenance Bay** – A cluster of server racks, some with blinking warning LEDs indicating hardware failures.  \n3. **Tool & Parts Storage** – A wall of labeled drawers, cabinets, and spare components for emergency repairs.  \n4. **Troubleshooting Whiteboard Zone** – A standing meeting area with a large glass board covered in incident reports, recovery steps, and hastily scribbled SQL queries.  \n\nEach area is **physically connected but functionally distinct**, requiring agents to move between them for different tasks.  \n\n---  \n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Monitoring Hub**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- A **12-monitor dashboard array**, mounted on a curved steel frame, displaying real-time graphs of CPU load, memory usage, and request latency.  \n- A **heavy, L-shaped workstation desk**, reinforced to hold multiple high-end machines, with a sliding keyboard tray and cable management sleeves.  \n- A **floor-mounted server cabinet** housing the local caching proxy (Varnish) and a secondary memcached node.  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Primary terminal (Linux workstation)** – Currently logged in as `admin`, with an open SSH session to a misbehaving database node.  \n- **Emergency stop button (red, covered by plastic shield)** – Triggers a failover to backup systems if pressed.  \n- **Hardware diagnostic tablet** – Wirelessly connected to rack sensors, showing thermal hotspots on Rack 3B.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Desk phone (Cisco IP model)** – On-hook, but last call log shows \"Network Ops – 2 min ago.\"  \n- **Label maker (Brother PT-D210)** – Half-loaded with black tape, last used to label a new SSD.  \n- **USB drive rack** – Contains five labeled drives: \"Backup Configs,\" \"Kernel Patches,\" \"Audit Logs (Q2).\"  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Sticky notes** on the bezels of two monitors:  \n  - \"Check cache-hit ratio after 20:00\"  \n  - \"Jenkins build #4421 failed – retry?\"  \n- **A half-empty coffee cup** with a faded \"I ♥ Open Source\" logo.  \n- **A framed \"Uptime: 99.999%\" certificate** from last year, slightly crooked.  \n\n---  \n### **B. Rack Maintenance Bay**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Four server racks (42U height)** – Racks 3A and 3B have **warning lights** (amber LED blinking on PSU 2).  \n- **Overhead cable trays** – Bundles of Cat6 and fiber-optic lines, some dangling where recent maintenance was done.  \n- **Emergency power unit (APC Smart-UPS)** – A 150kg floor-standing unit with a digital load display.  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Faulty drive (2.5\" SSD, Toshiba model)** – Partially ejected from Rack 3B, labeled \"Node 7 – Replace ASAP.\"  \n- **Thermal camera (Fluke TiS20)** – Left on a cart, last used to scan Rack 2 for overheating.  \n- **Locked maintenance panel** – Requires a keycard (located in the Tool Storage) to access backup power controls.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Spare rack rails** – Leaning against the wall, still in plastic wrapping.  \n- **KVM switch (4-port, Avocent)** – Currently set to \"Node 4,\" displaying a frozen BIOS screen.  \n- **Rolling tool cart** – Contains a basic screwdriver set and anti-static wrist straps.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Dusty \"Server Room Rules\" poster** – One corner peeling off, listing \"No Food\" and \"ESD Protection Required.\"  \n- **Scorch mark on the floor** – Near Rack 1, from an old PSU failure.  \n- **Expired fire extinguisher** – Mounted on the wall, inspection tag outdated by 3 months.  \n\n---  \n### **C. Tool & Parts Storage**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Wall-mounted pegboard** – Hanging screwdrivers, cable testers, and a label gun.  \n- **Industrial parts cabinet (60 drawers, red metal)** – Labeled with component types (e.g., \"SATA cables,\" \"RAM modules\").  \n- **Refrigerator-sized battery backup** – A 200kg unit with a manual bypass lever (requires two people to move).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Rack keycard (HID Prox)** – Inside drawer #14, labeled \"Maintenance Override.\"  \n- **Oscilloscope (Tektronix TBS1052B)** – On a shelf, last used to diagnose a network sync issue.  \n- **Sealed static-shield bag** – Contains a replacement RAID controller, labeled \"For Rack 3A – Priority.\"  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Barcode scanner (Zebra DS8178)** – On the counter, next to a stack of asset tags.  \n- **Spool of velcro cable ties** – Half-used, tangled slightly.  \n- **Bin of loose screws** – Mostly M3 and M4 sizes, some mismatched.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **A \"World's Best Sysadmin\" mug** – Full of pens and USB drives.  \n- **Outdated motherboard** – On a shelf, marked \"For parts only.\"  \n- **A sticky note on the cabinet**: \"Don’t use drawer #22 – loose latch.\"  \n\n---  \n### **D. Troubleshooting Whiteboard Zone**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **8-foot glass whiteboard** – Covered in multi-colored dry-erase notes, including:  \n  - \"Cache invalidation bug → Varnish config?\"  \n  - \"DB deadlock on transactions table – optimize indexes?\"  \n- **Round meeting table** – Scratched surface, with four mismatched office chairs.  \n- **Wall-mounted NTP server display** – Showing slight drift (+12ms).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Incident binder (3-inch thick)** – Open to a section titled \"Memcached Failures – Recovery Steps.\"  \n- **Red emergency phone** – Direct line to the network operations center.  \n- **Wireless presentation clicker** – Lost under a pile of printed logs.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Coffee machine (Keuring)** – Out of water, with an empty pod tray.  \n- **Stack of post-it notes** – Some with scribbled IP addresses.  \n- **Broken chair** – One wheel missing, pushed into a corner.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **A \"Days Since Last Outage\" counter** – Stuck at \"3\" with a frowny face.  \n- **A framed photo** – Team picture from last year's holiday party.  \n- **Dusty rubber plant** – On a filing cabinet, mostly dead.  \n\n---  \n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The 200kg battery backup** in Tool Storage cannot be moved by one person (dimensions: 1.2m x 0.8m, requires two agents to lift).  \n- **A rack-mounted server (Dell PowerEdge, 80kg)** in the Maintenance Bay is partially dislodged—needs realignment by two agents to avoid damage.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among five **SSD drives** on the workbench, only one matches the required replacement (marked \"Node 7 – FW v2.1\"). The others have mismatched labels, forcing agents to verify before installation.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** A server in R"
