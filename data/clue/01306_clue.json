  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *High-End Wedding Planning Studio*  \n**Core Concept:** A luxurious, high-pressure wedding planning studio in the final hours before a celebrity wedding. The space is bustling with stylists, florists, coordinators, and technicians, each managing critical last-minute tasks. The scene is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Time constraints** (wedding in 3 hours) forcing parallel task execution.  \n- **Specialized roles** (florist vs. AV technician vs. stylist) requiring coordination.  \n- **Physical constraints** (heavy decor, fragile items, locked closets) necessitating collaboration.  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Planning Hub** – Central command with mood boards, schedules, and a floorplan-covered table. Tense atmosphere, ringing phones.  \n2. **Bridal Prep Suite** – Plush seating, vanity stations, garment racks. Stressful yet glamorous, with scattered accessories.  \n3. **Floral Workshop** – Overflowing with blooms, vases, and half-assembled centerpieces. Fragile, perishable, and time-sensitive.  \n4. **AV & Logistics Closet** – Packed with lighting rigs, cables, and locked equipment cases. Technical chaos.  \n5. **Guest Welcome Lounge** – Stylish but cluttered with welcome bags, place cards, and a malfunctioning photo booth.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Planning Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A 4m-long reclaimed oak table, scattered with fabric swatches, venue blueprints, and a half-drunk espresso.  \n- A floor-to-ceiling magnetic mood board (3m x 2m) pinned with client photos and sticky notes reading \"NO PEONIES – ALLERGIES\" and \"VIP TABLE: 6 FT FROM DJ.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Wedding timeline binder (open, tabbed sections)** – Missing pages for \"Cake Cutting.\"  \n- **Sealed courier envelope (A4, tamper-proof sticker)** – Contains the marriage license, requires scissors to open.  \n- **Malfunctioning walkie-talkie** – Stuck on static; needs battery replacement.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Label maker (low on tape, \"E\" key stuck).  \n- Mini fridge (humming, stocked with sparkling water and wilted kale wraps).  \n- Charging station (tangled cables, one dead iPad).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Framed magazine cover: \"Top 10 Weddings of 2023.\"  \n- Dried-out calligraphy pen set beside a coffee-stained seating chart.  \n- A wilting orchid in a cracked ceramic pot.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Bridal Prep Suite**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A vintage tri-fold mirror (2m tall, one panel misaligned).  \n- Silk-upholstered fainting couch (stained with foundation).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Veil (hand-embroidered, tangled in a jewelry tree)** – Requires two agents to detangle without damage.  \n- **Mismatched earrings** – One is on the vanity, the other rolled under a chair.  \n- **Locked jewelry case (digital keypad)** – Code written on a napkin in the planner’s pocket.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Steamer (overheating, water tank empty).  \n- Rolling garment rack (stuck wheel, holds 12 dresses in garment bags).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Disposable lipstick-stained coffee cups.  \n- A \"Bride\" sash crumpled near a half-eaten croissant.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Floral Workshop**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Stainless steel worktable (3m long, strewn with petals and wire cuttings).  \n- Industrial flower cooler (glass door fogged, internal temperature display flickering).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Bridal bouquet (unassembled)** – Requires specific orchids (cooler) and ribbon (locked supply drawer).  \n- **Leaking water tube** – Puddle forming near electrical outlets.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Pile of discarded thorny rose stems (hazardous).  \n- A clipboard with a scribbled note: \"Cavallari – NO LILIES!!\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Broken terra-cotta pots in a recycling bin.  \n- A dried corsage pinned to a corkboard.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The 150kg marble ceremony arch** in storage—requires 4 agents to maneuver through narrow double doors.  \n- **The 2m-tall floral chandelier**—fragile, must be carried while balanced on a pulley system.  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among five similar courier envelopes, only one has a **red \"URGENT\" stamp** and **smudged postmark**—critical for the marriage license.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** To fix the **flickering cooler (problem)**, agents must:  \n  1. Find the **circuit breaker (behind a stacked crate)**.  \n  2. Use the **voltage tester (in AV closet)** to diagnose the issue.  \n\n**Purposeful Noise:**  \n- A **fake \"emergency backup bouquet\"** (obviously plastic flowers) distracts from locating the real orchids.  \n- Three **identical-looking scissors**—only one has the **ergonomic grip** needed to open the courier envelope safely.  \n\n---  \nThis scene is a pressure cooker of time-sensitive, physically constrained, and role-specific tasks—ripe for multi-agent coordination, tool-use chains, and layered reasoning amid realistic clutter."
