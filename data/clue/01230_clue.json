At that time there were 86 proposal followers. However, now several days after moving to the commitment phase, very few of those initial 86 have \"committed\" to the proposal.\n\nWhat do you think the reason for this is? Is the automatic e-mail not clear enough for new users that they need to \"commit\" to the proposal? Perhaps they think they are already committed because they \"followed\" the proposal during the definition stage? Can you e-mail the followers again?\n\nThanks in advance for your replies.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 2 down vote accepted\n\nIt's hard to say for certain, but I can make a few observations…\n\nThe two stages, \"Definition\" and \"Commitment\" serve very different purposes. In \"Definition\", any interest in the site is still very much an abstraction; a bunch of people waxing philosophical about \"what would this hypothetical site be about?\" That part is easy. The second part is the more difficult. That's where people have to get real and \"commit\" to using this site they designed. So, two possibilities: either the followers weren't the hard-core, committed audience you need, or they simply lost interest over the 3-1/2 months it took to drift over the line into Commitment.\n\nEither way, don't despair. A \"Dermatology\" site is squarely within the demographic of what will make a great Stack Exchange site. But perhaps our current generation of Stack Exchange users aren't going to be the ones to build it. Now is the time to renew efforts to reach out and develop support for a proposal that's all-but-ready to go. Serious users have such an easier job of it now. They just have to want to show up.\n\nAnother approach is to tap the resources and brainstorm with the Area 51 community directly. We are in the final stages of grouping proposals into \"Categories\" and adding meta discussions specifically for each of these more-focused groups. The benefit to you is that you can ask communities that have roughly the same interests as yourself. Perhaps together you can figure out what is slowing progress and how to best rally the support you need.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYou must log in to answer this question.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Dermatopathology Research Lab – A High-Stakes Collaboration Hub\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThis is a **cutting-edge dermatopathology research laboratory**, a bustling hub where medical researchers, lab technicians, and AI-assisted diagnostic systems collaborate under tight deadlines to analyze skin tissue samples, validate new diagnostic protocols, and troubleshoot equipment malfunctions.  \n\nThe lab is inherently **multi-agent** due to:  \n- **Heavy equipment** requiring coordinated operation.  \n- **Time-sensitive sample processing** where parallel workflows are essential.  \n- **Safety-critical procedures** (biohazard handling, sterile protocols) that demand supervision and cross-checking.  \n- **Technical troubleshooting** (AI diagnostics, malfunctioning lab machines) requiring specialized expertise.  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe lab is divided into four interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Specimen Intake & Prep Area** – A sterile, brightly lit space with biosafety cabinets, sample trays, and labeling stations.  \n2. **Microscopy & Analysis Bay** – A dimly lit section with high-powered microscopes, digital imaging stations, and diagnostic AI terminals.  \n3. **Equipment & Storage Hub** – A crowded maintenance zone with centrifuges, cryostorage units, and supply racks.  \n4. **Collaborative Workspace** – A central area with whiteboards, a holographic projector for case discussions, and a coffee station (because researchers never sleep).  \n\n#### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n---  \n### **1. Specimen Intake & Prep Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Biosafety Cabinet (Class II)** – A large, sealed workstation with UV sterilization, HEPA filtration, and glove ports.  \n- **Refrigerated Sample Rack** – A stainless-steel unit with labeled slots for 50 biopsy cassettes (current temp: 4°C ±0.5°C).  \n- **Digital Labeling Station** – A touchscreen terminal with barcode printer and RFID tag encoder.  \n\n**b.
