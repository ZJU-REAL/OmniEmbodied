In fact, the possibility of another Dwightmare is built into the contract.\n\nThe contract contains an early termination option for after the 2015-16 season. In other words, Dwight Howard may be in the free agent market again. He can either resign with the Rockets for a five-year deal or change teams. Additionally, Howard is guaranteed 15 percent of the money left in his contract if the Rockets decide to trade him—which would be surprising since they went so hard to get him in the first place.\n\nHoward pretty much made sure he was a winner in this deal. Losing Kobe Bryant as a follower sucks, but it's a small loss.\n\nRELATED: Unsurprisingly, Dwight Howard Has Changed His Mind (Updated)\nRELATED: The 25 Dumbest Front Office Moves in Sports History\n\n[via Yahoo!

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: Professional Sports Agency's Contract War Room**  \n\n#### **Overall Scene Theme & Core Concept**  \nA high-stakes **sports contract negotiation war room** in a luxury agency office, moments before a critical free-agency deadline. The space is designed for intense collaboration between agents, analysts, and executives, where multi-million-dollar decisions must be made under pressure.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Shared Physical Tasks:** Heavy contract binders, large whiteboards requiring two people to move, secured document cabinets needing simultaneous keycard access.  \n- **Information Asymmetry:** Different experts (legal, financial, branding) have unique access to documents, requiring data-sharing.  \n- **Temporal Pressure:** Clocks count down to the negotiation deadline, forcing parallel task delegation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout & Area Descriptions**  \nThe **Contract War Room** is a sleek, glass-and-mahogany boardroom with three interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Main Negotiation Table** – A 5-meter-long smoked-glass table with embedded touchscreens, surrounded by ergonomic leather chairs. The focal point for final deal approvals.  \n2. **Analyst Hub** – A secondary workstation with three wall-mounted 4K monitors, financial models running in real-time, and stacks of player performance reports.  \n3. **Secure Archive Nook** – A reinforced corner with biometric-locked filing cabinets and a shredder for sensitive documents.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Negotiation Table**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Glass Negotiation Table** (5m x 1.5m, 200kg, requires two people to reposition) with embedded **touchscreen panels** (currently displaying Dwight Howard’s contract clauses in red highlights).  \n- **Executive Chairs** (8x, black leather, adjustable lumbar support, one slightly scuffed from frequent rolling).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Dwightmare\" Contract Binder** (12cm thick, labeled **\"CONFIDENTIAL – EARLY TERMINATION OPTION\"**, with a **blue \"URGENT\" sticky note** on page 47).  \n- **Digital Signature Pad** (flashing **\"AWAITING EXECUTION\"**, battery at 18%).  \n- **Salary Cap Calculator** (a physical slider-based device with **stuck mechanism**—requires dislodging).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Conference Phone** (muted, caller ID shows **\"Rockets GM – Incoming\"**).  \n- **Mini Fridge** (stocked with Fiji water and **one missing energy drink**).  \n- **Wireless Chargers** (three, one **overheating**).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Jerseys** (autographed by past clients, one **slightly crooked**).  \n- **Stress Ball** (imprinted with **\"Deal Closer\"**, split at the seam).  \n- **Scattered Sticky Notes** (one reads **\"Kobe isn’t following anymore – adjust PR strategy\"**).  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Analyst Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Triple Monitor Setup** (left screen: **real-time salary cap projections**, middle: **Twitter trends on #Dwightmare**, right: **a frozen Excel model**).  \n- **Adjustable Standing Desk** (stuck in mid-height position, **whirring faintly**).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Player Valuation Report** (**printed**, with **handwritten corrections** in red ink: **\"15% trade guarantee = leverage??\"**).  \n- **USB Drive** (**encrypted**, left in the port, labeled **\"Howard Exit Scenarios\"**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label Maker** (**out of tape**).  \n- **Coffee Machine** (**empty water tank**, beeping intermittently).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Worst Front Office Moves\" List** (printed from Complex.com, **circled entry #14**).  \n- **Dented Trophy** (**\"2016 Agent of the Year\"**, dust collecting in the crevices).  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Secure Archive Nook**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Biometric File Cabinet** (requires **two keycards + fingerprint** to open).  \n- **Industrial Shredder** (**jammed**, with a **half-destroyed contract** visible in the tray).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Backup Hard Drive** (**unplugged**, in a **Faraday cage** labeled **\"BREACH PROTOCOL\"**).  \n- **Emergency Red Folder** (**\"Trade Fallback Plans – DO NOT OPEN UNTIL ETO\"**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Fire Extinguisher** (**expired next month**).  \n- **Emergency Flashlight** (**flickering**).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Disconnected Security Camera** (dangling by one wire).  \n- **Peeling \"CONFIDENTIAL\" Decal** (half-scratched off).  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- The **negotiation table (200kg)** cannot be moved solo.  \n- The **biometric cabinet** requires **two keycards** (one held by the legal team, one by finance).  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five contract copies**, only one has the **blue \"URGENT\" sticky note** and **page 47 dog-eared**.  \n  - A **decorative blue binder** nearby acts as a distractor.  \n- **Compound Problem-Solving:**  \n  - **Problem:** The shredder is jammed with a sensitive document.  \n  - **Solution:** The **toolkit** (under the analyst desk) has pliers to clear it, but the **drawer is locked** (key is in the fridge)."
