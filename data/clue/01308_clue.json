Photograph: Suki Dhanda\n\nTony Blair invested some money in school dinners, but you would have got better value for money if I'd spent it myself.\n\nI get zero say in my children's names. If I had a boy I'd like to call him Elvis, but my wife would like to call him Honeydew or something. What's wrong with Elvis Oliver? You'd want to shag him and you'd want to be his mate.\n\nI don't endorse swearing. Idiots do it, and I happen to do it because I can't express myself better. Ministry of Food was particularly emotional and a lot of stuff upset me. We only got complaints after the papers picked up on it, then Wogan chimes in. It's not Blankety Blank; you go up to Rotherham, spend four or five months there and try to make a difference and I'll get a few \"fucks\" out of you, Terry. But if I did it now I'd edit it all out.\n\nWhen my grandad's brother died, I found out I was sixth-generation Sudanese. I need to go on Who Do You Think You Are? and find out more, but Channel 4 wouldn't be very pleased.\n\nIf you're comfortable you're doing no good for anyone. I wrote to the News of the World and asked to write for them. If I wrote for this mag, I'd be preaching to the converted.\n\nThere's been three CEOs while I've been with Sainsbury's. Some things, like chicken, took them by surprise a bit. I wouldn't employ me, frankly.\n\nWhen I was 14 I thought I'd like to run a pub in an Essex village, like my dad. Not cooking birthday dinners for Brad Pitt and being his mate.\n\nI could make you a millionaire. Our national dish is fish and chips, but how many good chippies are there? I could show you in a day, how to make home-made batter, fantastic tartare sauce, source the best fish - it's so easy. It's not about posh, it's just about good grub.\n\nNice people have a healthy relationship with food, and miserable people don't. Having a healthy attitude towards cooking and food is really good for the soul. I'm not wrong.\n\nI shot an alligator in Louisiana. They're not endangered, but they are a pest - they live in the rice fields and are mauling up rice farmers. I'm sure someone will whinge about it - like when I cut the throat of the lamb in Italy. Frankly, it's not supposed to be nice, or pretty, it's supposed to be bloody and gory, and if more people saw that they might wonder what they are eating every time they go to the supermarket.\n\nThe last time I slid down a bannister was two weeks ago, at Stansted airport. It did chafe a bit.\n\nThe way to anyone's heart is through their stomach.\n\nChickens and pigs have been treated like shite for years. You could argue that it's been about making food affordable to the masses, but ultimately it saves people cash that they spend on a load of old crap, like widescreen TVs. Meat shouldn't be cheap - it's a life.\n\nIt's a long time since I had a Big Mac. But even the likes of McDonald's are doing quite radical things, they're doing more than a lot of posh restaurants - they sell more organic milk and free range eggs than anyone else in the industry. I can't even believe I'm sticking up for them.\n\nI could have retired 10 years ago, at 24. But while I'm young and fit, if I'm clever enough and embrace good people, we can do some really good stuff. You've got to keep creating.\n\nI'm a professional shit-stirrer.\n\nJamie's America is published by Penguin, £26\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Experimental Community Kitchen\"**\n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nInspired by Jamie Oliver’s passion for accessible, ethical food and kitchen education, this **Experimental Community Kitchen** is a hybrid between a teaching space, a research lab, and a bustling restaurant prep area. The environment is designed for **multi-agent collaboration**—chefs, students, and food scientists must work together to prepare, experiment, and solve culinary challenges.  \n\nThe scene is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy/Large Objects** (sacks of flour, industrial mixers) that require multiple people to move.  \n- **Precision Tasks** (adjusting lab-grade scales, calibrating sous-vide machines).  \n- **Time-Sensitive Coordination** (food prep stations must be managed simultaneously to avoid spoilage).  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe kitchen is split into **five zones**, each with distinct functions:  \n\n1. **Main Cooking Station** – Industrial stoves, ovens, and prep surfaces. The heart of the kitchen.  \n2. **Science & Measurement Corner** – Precision scales, pH testers, and ingredient analyzers.  \n3. **Cold Storage & Pantry** – Walk-in fridge, dry goods shelves, and fermentation station.  \n4. **Dishwashing & Waste Management** – Industrial sinks, compost bins, and recycling stations.  \n5. **Instruction & Planning Hub** – A whiteboard-covered meeting space with recipe binders and a large communal table.  \n\nEach area is **densely packed** with objects that facilitate **collaboration, problem-solving, and tool-use**.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Cooking Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial 8-Burner Stove** (1.5m wide, cast iron grates, one burner flickering irregularly).  \n- **Double-Decker Convection Oven** (door slightly misaligned, requiring force to close properly).  \n- **Stainless Steel Worktable** (3m long, scratched surface with faint knife marks).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Golden Chef’s Knife\"** (the only one with a Damascus steel pattern, stored in a magnetic strip).  \n- **Overheating Deep Fryer** (oil temp reads 220°C, blinking a warning light).  \n- **Mystery Ingredient Jar** (unlabeled, containing a bright red powder with a faint sulfur smell).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Digital Timer** (counting down from 12:00, faint beeping sound).  \n- **Spice Rack** (27 labeled jars, but \"cumin\" and \"coriander\" are swapped).  \n- **Oil Splatter Guards** (two available, one cracked).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed \"Kitchen Safety Rules\" Poster** (slightly yellowed, corners peeling).  \n- **Chalkboard with Yesterday’s Menu** (half-erased, smudged).  \n- **Dented Aluminum Tray** (used as an impromptu spoon rest, stained with old sauce).  \n\n---\n\n#### **B. Science & Measurement Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Lab-Grade Digital Scales** (max 5kg, requires calibration).  \n- **Microscope & Slide Set** (for food texture analysis).  \n- **pH Meter Station** (with a sticky note: \"DO NOT USE FOR VINEGAR AGAIN\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Contaminated\" Petri Dish** (sealed, labeled \"Sample 7B – DO NOT OPEN\").  \n- **Broken Refractometer** (displays \"ERR\" when powered on).  \n- **Mystery Liquid in Graduated Cylinder** (amber-colored, unlabeled).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Binder of Food Safety Protocols** (dog-eared, missing pages 14-17).  \n- **Set of Calibration Weights** (stored in foam casing, 10g weight missing).  \n- **Thermal Camera** (left on, showing residual heat from the stove).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee-Stained Research Paper** (title: \"Fermentation Rates in Sourdough\").  \n- **Dusty \"Scientist of the Month\" Trophy** (from 2018).  \n- **Decorative Periodic Table Poster** (with doodles near \"NaCl\").  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **50kg Sack of Organic Flour** (too heavy for one agent; requires two to lift safely).  \n- **Industrial Mixer Bowl** (1.2m diameter, needs one person to stabilize while another pours ingredients).  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five unlabeled spice jars, only **one** has a **blue lid, handwritten \"HOT!\" in Sharpie, and a cracked seal**—agents must discern the correct one while ignoring similar-looking jars in the background.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:** A **locked recipe binder** (combination needed) has the code written on a **sticky note inside a drawer** in the Instruction Hub. Agents must communicate to retrieve it.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes:**  \nThis **Experimental Community Kitchen** is a **dense, dynamic environment** where agents must **collaborate, problem-solve, and improvise**. Every object has **purpose**, every corner has **clutter**, and every task requires **coordination**. The scene is **alive**—flickering lights, faint smells, and hidden challenges ensure **rich, embodied interaction**.  \n\nWould you like an additional **\"Emergency Scenario\"** layer (e.g., a gas leak, spoiled ingredients) to further stress-test agent collaboration?"
