Are you saying that is not detected just like a \"serial upvoter\"? –  raven Jul 3 '09 at 0:37\n@raven: This is a much cleaner solution than a script that checks daily. –  GEOCHET Jul 3 '09 at 0:38\nA user can only do a relatively small amount of damage per day. Isn't it limited to 30 votes? So, you lose 60 points for at most ~24 hours. Is that really a problem? –  raven Jul 3 '09 at 0:46\nYou're thinking of 1 user and 1 day. Grudges are a powerful thing. –  Ólafur Waage Jul 3 '09 at 0:50\n@raven: It was enough of a problem to create Jeff's ugly solution. –  GEOCHET Jul 3 '09 at 0:56\n@Ólafur Waage: You're saying some people amass armies of fellow SO users to help assault other SO users who have offended them? I'm not sure I follow you. Can you describe a scenario? –  raven Jul 3 '09 at 0:59\n@Rich B: \"Jeff's ugly solution\" being the daily check vs. the instant check? –  raven Jul 3 '09 at 1:01\n@raven: It happens to me, I will see 4 or 5 old posts that will have -4 or -6 on them after someone freaked out about an edit. –  GEOCHET Jul 3 '09 at 1:08\n@raven: Yes. A daily recalc is ugly. An algorithmic limit is clean. –  GEOCHET Jul 3 '09 at 1:08\n@Rich B, why is the current mechanism ugly? –  Timothy Carter Jul 3 '09 at 1:36\nWell, in terms of training your users, the fact that it does it in the backend every night, doesn't really help. The users should be informed while they're doing the undesirable action that they cannot do that. –  devinb Jul 3 '09 at 11:43\n@RichB \"It happens to me, I will see 4 or 5 old posts that will have -4 or -6 on them after someone freaked out about an edit. \" More likely it is due to your comments and perceived attitude. Given your voting record (2x more downvotes than upvotes) the phrase \"You reap what you sow\" comes to mind. How can you complain about downvotes when you're one of the most prolific downvoters? –  tim Jul 20 '09 at 15:57\nI don't like the idea of having a time limit... would make detecting a serial downvoter much harder. –  Carlos Heuberger Jan 13 '10 at 17:34\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 4 down vote accepted\n\nTo generate some sort of working algorithm for preventing serial downvoting. You would have to look at the logs of a real serial downvote and gather points from that.\n\n  • Is the user going through the targets answer/question list and downvoting quickly ?\n  • Is the user only downvoting new answers by the target\n  • Is the user doing this over a large period of time?\n  • Has the user ever upvoted the target?\n  • Are there sudden bursts of downvotes to a question that isn't on the front page (or a recent question)?\nshare|improve this answer\n\nSerial-downvoting is already detected and prevented - only without the popup, something that has been discussed on the StackOverflow podcast a few times (I cannot find mention of it in the transcript however)\n\nIf I recall, the reasoning is basically if you tell the user \"we've stopped counting your votes again $user\", they'll work a way around it. If you silently ignore them they continue on, not causing any real damage..\n\n\nfrom Podcast 026\n\nThere was a better discussion of this subject, but I cannot find it (the above quote took about 20 searches to find..)\n\nshare|improve this answer\nYes, we all know this, but it is ugly. –  GEOCHET Jul 3 '09 at 1:09\n\nThis would be under the assumption that some sort of daily limit on votes per user is implemented. But if that ends up being the case, I think that this would be a pretty handy way of notifying a user.\n\nIf there was a way to detect that you were giving votes in rapid succession (say less than 5 minutes apart) to the same user, that would make it much better to detect cases of serial downvoting instead of just cases of two people being active at the same time and their votes coming rapidly.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYou must log in to answer this question.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"Moderation Command Center\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA **Moderation Command Center** is a bustling hub where teams of human and AI moderators collaboratively monitor, analyze, and regulate activity on a massive online platform. The environment is **high-stakes, fast-paced, and information-dense**, requiring **real-time coordination** between multiple agents to prevent abuse, detect anomalies, and enforce rules.  \n\nThe scene is **inherently collaborative** because:  \n- **Heavy data processing** requires distributed tasks (some agents filter content, others verify patterns, others communicate with users).  \n- **Physical constraints** (large server racks, locked cabinets, heavy equipment) necessitate teamwork for movement and access.  \n- **Complex reasoning** is needed to distinguish between false alarms and real threats amid a sea of noisy data.  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe **Moderation Command Center** is a **warehouse-sized room** with distinct functional zones:  \n\n1. **Main Monitoring Hub** – A central workstation with multiple screens tracking live activity.  \n2. **Data Storage & Server Racks** – Heavy-duty servers storing logs and voting histories.  \n3. **Forensic Analysis Station** – A secured desk with specialized tools for deep inspection.  \n4. **Moderator Break Room** – A small lounge with personal items and a coffee machine.  \n5. **Secure Archive Closet** – A locked storage room for flagged content and evidence.  \n6. **Network Operations Panel** – A wall-mounted control station with emergency switches.  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Monitoring Hub**  \n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **12-meter-long curved workstation** with **10 high-resolution monitors** displaying real-time voting logs, user activity heatmaps, and moderation queues.  \n- **Adjustable office chairs** (some with worn-out armrests, others with lumbar support).  \n- **Overhead LED panels** casting a bluish glow (one flickers intermittently).  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Serial Voting Detection Console\"** – A dedicated terminal running anomaly-detection algorithms.  \n- **Emergency Lockout Switch** – A red button under a protective plastic cover (labeled \"VOTE FREEZE\").  \n- **Three wireless headsets** (one has a low battery warning blinking).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Labeled binders** (\"Moderation Protocols Vol. 1-3\").  \n- **A wireless charging pad** (with two phones sitting on it).  \n- **A whiteboard** scribbled with notes like \"Check User #4821 – sudden -5s?\"  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A framed \"Top Moderator of the Year\" certificate** (slightly crooked).  \n- **A dying potted fern** on a filing cabinet.  \n- **Sticky notes** with motivational quotes (\"Stay vigilant!\").  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Data Storage & Server Racks**  \n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four industrial-grade server racks**, each 2.5m tall with blinking indicator lights.  \n- **A rolling ladder** for accessing high shelves.  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Vote Log Backup Drive\"** – A heavy (25kg) standalone storage unit with a bio-lock.  \n- **A faulty server node** (flashing red, emitting a faint buzzing noise).  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Spare rack-mounted hard drives** in labeled anti-static bags.  \n- **A cart with replacement cooling fans**.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A faded \"Data Integrity Matters\" poster**.  \n- **Dusty cables** coiled on a shelf.  \n\n---  \n\n*(Continued for remaining areas...)*  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The Vote Log Backup Drive (25kg, bulky)** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **A jammed server rack drawer** – Needs one agent to hold it steady while another pries it open.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five suspect user profiles**, only **one** has a **red \"HIGH RISK\" tag**, a **recent IP change**, and a **history of deleted comments**.  \n- **Compound Problem-Solving:** A **locked forensic terminal** requires a **keycard** (found in the break room, inside a coffee-stained manual).  \n\n### **Dynamic Distractions:**  \n- **A flickering LED panel** may obscure critical alerts.  \n- **A ringing desk phone** (unknown caller) adds urgency.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes:**  \nThis **dense, high-stakes environment** is built for **multi-agent problem-solving**, where **collaboration is mandatory**, **reasoning is layered**, and **distractions are realistic**. Every object serves a purpose—whether functional, atmospheric, or as a potential task hook."
