Other players like Amazon, Hulu, and even MS might all ramp up their efforts.\n\nBut you're right. This may be the tipping point when fans become enemies. When corporate gets greedy. But don't get your panties in a bunch. If Netflix corporate sees that this was an unpopular idea, they'll release a platinum membership which will allow both streams and dvds (but not allow blu-rays, lol).\n\nRE: Morons\nBy Mitch101 on 7/12/2011 9:13:13 PM , Rating: 5\nIm ok with this. Im a streamer and could care less about getting a physical disc. I though I did at first but really the discs that arrive in the mail I find useless and return them without even watching them most of the time. So Netflix is just risking the disc in the mail for only $2.00 more.\n\nIm also all for Netflix making a profit too they never once screwed around like Blockbuster did with me.\n\nBesides $2.00 less is two redbox rentals at my local gas station if needed.\n\nRE: Morons\nBy jeepga on 7/12/2011 10:39:30 PM , Rating: 2\nNetflix had an 88% increase in profit last reporting cycle. They're making good profits. This is their second price increase in a year.\n\nI couldn't care less if there is a reason behind it. It's unacceptable and I will be cancelling my subscription before the increase goes into effect.\n\nRE: Morons\nBy Mitch101 on 7/12/2011 11:08:16 PM , Rating: 5\nIts a $2.00 price cut for me.\n\nNot long ago the only option was DVD rental no streaming and it cost more than $8.00.\n\nI would also bet that increase was due to Blockbusters Chapter 11 not all of them went to redbox.\n\nI even look at Hulu+ at $7.99 and that has commercials and think Netflix is a better offer where the two compete with one another where Netflix is the $8.00 commercial free version.\n\nI still think its a good bargain if not there is always redbox.\n\nRE: Morons\nBy FITCamaro on 7/13/2011 9:42:29 AM , Rating: 1\nYeah I might take this money from cutting DVDs off and go get Hulu Plus. I'll keep streaming for now.\n\nNetflix is risking shooting themselves in the foot here. I didn't mind the last price increase. But this one is a bit ridiculous. Charging roughly double the prior cost?\n\nSorry but if they were going to do this, they needed to provide reasons such as massive increases in licensing fees for movies. Put the blame on the movie industry. Not give a BS reason that amounts to \"We want more money\".\n\nNow if they take this (potentially, depending how many people cancel) higher revenue and drastically improve their streaming options, this could turn into a win for them.\n\nRE: Morons\n\n\nRE: Morons\nYou don't care if there actually was a reason?\n\n\nRE: Morons\n\n\n\n\n\nRE: Morons\nBy tigz1218 on 7/13/2011 8:41:58 AM , Rating: 3\nHow is it \"unacceptable\"? Was renting movies a fundamental right that I am unaware of? It's called capitalism, and when companies make mistakes, it opens the door for a competitor. Maybe that could be you. Learn from things like these how to capitalize, not get angry, and you will be a very successful person.\n\nRE: Morons\n\nRE: Morons\nBy rubbahbandman on 7/13/2011 12:18:20 PM , Rating: 2\nI assume the reasoning behind this is reducing SG&A (Selling, General & Admin expenses) and improving cash flows.\n\nIf you take a look at their quarterly report SG&A has increased substantially, no doubt a large portion is attributed to the physical media side of their business.\n\nIt seems a bit odd that they don't offer any sort of discount for bundled packages though...\n\nRE: Morons\nBy Denigrate on 7/13/2011 9:54:38 AM , Rating: 4\nI went to the streaming only option when they offered it, so this has zero effect on me. I hate physical media at this point as it's simply something else to keep track of around the house.\n\nI'd guess Netflix wants to move to streaming only, and this will help get them there.\n\nRE: Morons\n\nRE: Morons\n\nRE: Morons\nLast week I wanted to watch Transformers 2\n\nUhhh, why?\n\nRE: Morons\nI don't get it.\n\n\n\nRE: Morons\nBy icanhascpu on 7/19/2011 3:33:02 PM , Rating: 2\nWhat will help them get there is having content that matches the physical DVD service. Not upping the cost and adding little.\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Last Video Rental Store - A Dying Industry's Hidden Mission\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA once-thriving **\"Video Haven\" rental store**, now on the brink of closure, serves as the last bastion of physical media in a world dominated by streaming. However, beneath its nostalgic surface, the store secretly houses a **hidden backroom operation**—an underground archive preserving rare and banned films, maintained by a tight-knit group of cinephile employees. The environment is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy physical media** (film reels, crates of DVDs, bulky analog equipment) requiring multiple people to move.  \n- **A mix of public and hidden zones**, necessitating coordination between \"front-of-house\" clerks and \"backroom\" archivists.  \n- **Time-sensitive tasks** (e.g., transferring decaying film stock, repairing damaged discs before a customer notices).  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe store is divided into four key areas:  \n\n1. **Front Retail Zone** – A brightly lit but dated space with rows of DVD shelves, a checkout counter, and promotional posters peeling at the edges. The air smells faintly of popcorn from a broken machine.  \n2. **Employee Break Room** – A cramped space with a coffee-stained table, lockers, and a bulletin board filled with shift schedules and sticky notes.  \n3. **Storage/Backroom** – A dimly lit labyrinth of metal shelves stacked with returns, unsorted discs, and obsolete VHS tapes.  \n4. **Secret Archive Room** (hidden behind a false shelf) – A climate-controlled vault containing rare film reels, a vintage film scanner, and a workstation for digital preservation.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Front Retail Zone**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Checkout Counter (3m long, laminate surface, chipped at the edges)** – Equipped with an old POS system, a barcode scanner, and a sticky \"Out of Order\" sign on the credit card reader.  \n- **DVD Display Racks (steel frames, 2m tall, wobbly)** – Organized by genre, some shelves sagging under the weight of too many cases.  \n- **\"New Releases\" Carousel (spinning, squeaky)** – Half-empty, with a few Blu-rays mixed in.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Lost & Found\" Bin (plastic, dented, labeled in Sharpie)** – Contains misplaced DVDs, a single glove, and a cracked smartphone.  \n- **Disc Cleaning Machine (on the counter, stuck mid-cycle)** – A small \"Please Wait\" light blinks erratically.  \n- **Customer Return Cart (wheels squeak, piled high)** – DVDs in various states (some scratched, some missing cases).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Broken Popcorn Machine (unplugged, kernels stuck inside)** – A handwritten note: \"DO NOT USE - Fire Hazard.\"  \n- **Security Camera (one lens cracked, red LED blinking)** – Covers the entrance but not the backroom.  \n- **\"Employee Only\" Door (stiff hinge, requires a firm push)** – Leads to the break room.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Movie Posters (edges curling)** – *Jurassic Park*, *The Matrix*, and a water-stained *Titanic* promo.  \n- **Dusty Plastic Plants (on high shelves)** – One is missing leaves.  \n- **A Stack of \"Free Rental\" Coupons (expired last month)** – Left near the entrance.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Employee Break Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Folding Table (uneven legs, coffee rings)** – Seats four but only has three chairs.  \n- **Lockers (rusted hinges, peeling name tags)** – Belonging to employees (Jake, Maria, and \"TEMP\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Secret Archive\" Keycard (magnetic strip worn, tucked behind a locker)** – Grants access to the hidden room.  \n- **DVD Repair Toolkit (small, in a drawer)** – Contains microfiber cloths, scratch filler, and a mini screwdriver.  \n- **Shift Schedule (pencil edits, outdated)** – Shows who is supposed to be working today.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Microwave (door doesn’t fully close)** – Beeps loudly when used.  \n- **Mini-Fridge (humming loudly, condensation inside)** – Contains a single soda and an unlabeled Tupperware.  \n- **Landline Phone (cord tangled, no dial tone)** – A sticky note reads: \"Still broken - use cell.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old Magazines (2000s movie issues, dog-eared)** – *Empire*, *Total Film*.  \n- **A Framed Photo (faded, crooked)** – Shows the store's grand opening in 1998.  \n- **A Pile of Unwashed Mugs (one says \"World’s Okayest Employee\")** – Stains at the bottom.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Storage/Backroom**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Shelving Units (heavy steel, bolted to the floor)** – Overloaded with returned movies in unsorted bins.  \n- **Film Reel Storage Cabinet (locked, dented)** – Contains deteriorating 35mm prints.  \n\n**b.

Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Magnifying Lamp (adjustable arm, flickering bulb)** – For inspecting film damage.  \n- **Fireproof Safe (bolted to the floor)** – Contains original negatives.  \n- **Air Filtration System (whirring softly)** – Keeps dust out.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Film Awards (tarnished, on a shelf)** – \"Best Preservation Effort 2010.\"  \n- **A Notebook (handwritten logs of archived films)** – Some pages torn.  \n- **A Vintage Movie Poster (rare, behind glass)** – *Metropolis* (1927).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **50kg Film Shipping Boxes** – Too heavy for one person; requires two agents to lift onto the dolly.  \n- **Bulky Film Reel Cabinet** – Needs one person to hold the door while another retrieves a reel.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Finding the \"Corroded Reel\":** Among 20 similar-looking film cans, the critical one is the only one with:  \n  - A **blue \"ACID DAMAGE\" sticker**  \n  - A **handwritten \"LAST COPY\" label**  \n  - A **slightly warped lid**  \n  *(Distractor: Other cans have similar stickers but no warping.)*  \n- **Unlocking the Banned Films Vault:** Requires:  \n  1. Retrieving the **keycard from the break room locker**  \n  2. Using the **fingerprint scanner (must be an authorized employee)**  \n  3. Entering a **3-digit code (found on a sticky note in the repair toolkit)**  \n\nThis environment is **rich in multi-agent challenges**, from repairing discs before customers notice to secretly preserving decaying films before they’re lost forever. The density of objects ensures **realistic reasoning under clutter**, while the hidden mission adds urgency and depth.  \n\n---  \n**Final Note:** This scene is designed to feel"
