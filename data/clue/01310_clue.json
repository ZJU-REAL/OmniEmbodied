He said snowboarding, skateboarding and surfing are all hits with the band he started with two others in the 1980s when he was a teenager.\n\nThe testimony came at a trial stemming from a lawsuit the band brought against the Corona, California-based Monster.\n\nThe company admits it violated the Beastie Boys' copyrights by including its songs in a video that was online for five weeks. But it insists it should owe no more than $125,000, partly because it was viewed fewer than 14,000 times. The band wants over $2 million.\n\nOn Tuesday, Horovitz testified immediately after opening statements, saying flatly: \"We don't license our songs for products.\"\n\nCross-examined by attorney Dana Michelle Susman on Wednesday, Horovitz agreed that the band had licensed songs for use in a video made by a watch maker. But he said it was because his fellow band mate was friends with the company's owner and because the proceeds were destined for charity.\n\nHe said it was also natural that the band would support outdoor sports. The music included at least three Beastie Boys songs and accompanied video of snowboarders doing stunts and speaking on camera.\n\n\"We come from a community of snowboarders, skateboarders, extreme sports world, so we're enthusiasts of that,\" he testified.\n\n\nAt one point, he tried to steer the conversation back to Monster.\n\n\"We're here because Monster Energy used our music without a license,\" Horovitz said.\n\nAfter testifying, Horovitz returned to the first row of the courtroom's spectator section, where he sat with his wife and watched John Silva, his Los Angeles music manager, testify about contracts.\n",

Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling **extreme sports media production studio**, where a team is preparing a high-stakes promotional video for an upcoming snowboarding competition. The environment is inherently collaborative, requiring coordination between **athletes, videographers, editors, and sound engineers**. The studio is packed with specialized equipment, raw footage, and half-finished edits—demanding **precise teamwork** to meet tight deadlines.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment Transport:** Cameras, lighting rigs, and sound equipment require multiple people to move safely.  \n- **Specialized Roles:** Different agents must handle distinct tasks (e.g., operating a drone, syncing audio, reviewing footage).  \n- **Time-Sensitive Coordination:** Missing files, misplaced props, or incorrect setups create bottlenecks that require joint problem-solving.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe studio is divided into **four key zones**, each with a distinct function:  \n\n1. **Main Editing Bay** – The nerve center, where raw footage is compiled, edited, and reviewed.  \n2. **Equipment Storage & Prep Room** – Houses cameras, drones, stabilizers, and protective cases.  \n3. **Sound Mixing Booth** – A semi-isolated space for audio engineers to fine-tune tracks.  \n4. **Lounge & Meeting Area** – A casual space with reference materials, storyboards, and refreshments.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Editing Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **6-meter-long curved editing desk** with **five high-end workstations**, each running different software (Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, After Effects).  \n- A **wall-mounted 4K reference monitor** (currently displaying a paused snowboarding clip).  \n- A **heavy-duty server rack** (weight: 220kg) storing raw footage and project files.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Unlabeled external hard drives (x4)** – One contains the final edit, the others are backups or raw footage.  \n- **A locked USB drive** (labeled \"BEASTIE MIX – FINAL\") – Contains licensed music tracks.  \n- **A printed script** with handwritten notes in red ink (\"Cut at 0:43 – sync bass drop to jump\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Wireless keyboards** (two with low battery warnings).  \n- **A label maker** (out of tape).  \n- **A coffee-stained production schedule** (showing deadlines in 30-minute increments).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A Beastie Boys concert poster** (slightly torn at the edge).  \n- **A snowboard mounted on the wall** (autographed by pro riders).  \n- **A half-empty energy drink can** (Monster Energy, ironically).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Equipment Storage & Prep Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A reinforced steel equipment cage** (locked, requires keycard).  \n- **A wall-mounted pegboard** with **missing slots** where tools should be.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A drone with a damaged rotor** (requires repair before next shoot).  \n- **A case of 12 GoPro cameras** (three are missing, two have dead batteries).  \n- **A heavy-duty tripod** (weight: 18kg, too bulky for one person).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A tangled mess of HDMI and USB cables.**  \n- **A half-charged battery station** (three green lights, two red).  \n- **A first-aid kit** (partially open, gauze missing).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A dusty trophy** (for \"Best Extreme Sports Short Film 2018\").  \n- **A pile of old snowboarding magazines** (some pages dog-eared).  \n- **A broken skateboard** leaning against the wall.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Sound Mixing Booth**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A soundproof glass partition** (slightly smudged).  \n- **A large mixing console** (30+ sliders, some sticky from spilled soda).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A set of studio headphones** (left ear slightly muffled).  \n- **A USB labeled \"BEASTIE MASTER\"** (contains the final music mix).  \n- **A notebook** with EQ settings scribbled in pencil.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A metronome** (ticking faintly).  \n- **A stack of blank CDs** (mostly scratched).  \n- **A pencil sharpener** (full of shavings).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A vinyl record of *Licensed to Ill* (Beastie Boys)** (on display but dusty).  \n- **A neon \"ON AIR\" sign** (flickering intermittently).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **D. Lounge & Meeting Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A worn-out leather couch** (one spring loose).  \n- **A whiteboard** covered in half-erased brainstorming notes.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A misplaced keycard** (stuck between couch cushions).  \n- **A storyboard binder** (some pages out of order).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A microwave** (display stuck at 00:01).  \n- **A mini-fridge** (low on drinks).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A framed photo of a snowboarding trip** (slightly crooked).  \n- **A pile of takeout menus** (mostly for pizza).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Server Rack (220kg, 3m tall)** – Requires **two agents** to move safely.  \n- **Heavy Tripod (18kg, awkward shape)** – Must be carried by two people to avoid damage.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **four unlabeled hard drives**, the correct one has:  \n    - A **small scratch near the USB port**.  \n    - A **faint marker dot** (barely visible).  \n    - Is the **only one warm** (recently used).  \n  - **Distractors:** Other drives look identical, and a **decoy USB** labeled \"BACKUP\" sits nearby.  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The drone won’t start (damaged rotor).  \n  - **Solution:** A **replacement rotor** is in the locked equipment cage.  \n  - **Keycard Access:** The keycard is buried in the **lounge couch cushions**.  \n  - **Agents must:**  \n    1. Find the keycard.  \n    2. Unlock the cage.  \n    3. Retrieve the rotor.  \n    4. Install it correctly.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes on Potential Tasks:**  \nThis scene is **ripe for complexity**:  \n- **Time pressure** (editing deadlines).  \n- **Missing/damaged items** requiring scavenging.  \n- **Multi-step tool retrieval** (unlocking, finding, repairing).  \n- **Audio-visual synchronization challenges** (matching beats to jumps).  \n\nThe **density of objects** ensures agents must **navigate clutter, manage state changes, and coordinate roles**—making this an ideal testbed for embodied AI collaboration."
