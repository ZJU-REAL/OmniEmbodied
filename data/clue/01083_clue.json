The state suggested 20 percent, and Shelby County’s plan is to gradually work the percentage up to 20.\n\nThe exams include multiple choice, short answer and open response. Each section has between 35 and 38 multiple-choice questions that can be administered in two 45-minute sessions. The short answer and open response question will consist of 1-3 questions that can be administered in 45 minutes.\n\nThe exams provide alignment to state and national college readiness and common core and show the progress of a student, school and district.\n\nWhat is K-PREP like?\n\nThese new tests are given in grades 3-8 to gauge proficiency in reading, math, science, social studies and writing. The tests provide the ability to compare students to each other and to determine how well students have learned the skills. In Shelby County, the focus is on mastery of skills.\n\nPart of the tests are purchased and built to be used to compare nationally, while the other portion of the test is customized for Kentucky.\n\nThe assessments will consist of multiple choice, short answer and open response questions.\n\nThe tests align with common core standards and show the progress of a student, school and district.\n\nWhen are the tests?\n\nThe EXPLORE and PLAN tests are still given in the fall and the ACT test remains in March for juniors. K-PREP tests are administered during the final 14 days of the school year, and end-of-course exams occur when the material has been covered. In Shelby County, end-of-course exams began this week and, along with students taking Advanced Placement tests, end on the last day of school. K-PREP tests start for elementary schools on Monday and end Friday and middle and high school testing is May 21-29.\n\nWill there be writing tests?\n\nYes, for grades 5-6, 8, and 10-11. Those tests will include on-demand writing and editing/mechanics.\n\nHow will results be reported?\n\nEach school will receive individual student and school-based reports. Those reports will include national percentile scores from that portion of the test, and a ranking of novice, apprentice, proficient or distinguished from a combination of the national and Kentucky-specific portions of the test. End-of-course assessments, which are provided by ACT, can link performance to national results.\n",

Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling **district-level testing coordination center** during peak exam season. This is the nerve center where test materials are organized, distributed, and monitored for compliance. The environment is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Time-sensitive logistics** (tests must be prepped, tracked, and shipped to schools on schedule).  \n- **Strict security protocols** (sealed boxes, locked storage, and access restrictions).  \n- **Technical troubleshooting** (scanners, printers, and database errors require immediate fixes).  \n- **Multi-department coordination** (teachers, IT, and administrators must collaborate).  \n\nThe scene is a **modular workspace**—part warehouse, part office, part tech hub—with an atmosphere of controlled chaos: **stacks of test booklets, beeping label printers, whiteboards crammed with schedules, and the hum of last-minute adjustments.**  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n**A)** **Receiving & Inventory Zone** – A loading dock area with pallets of test materials, scanners, and industrial shelving.  \n**B)** **Secure Storage Room** – A locked chamber with climate-controlled cabinets for sensitive materials.  \n**C)** **Sorting & Packing Station** – Long tables with labeled bins, shrink-wrap machines, and scales.  \n**D)** **Admin Office** – A cluster of desks with dual monitors, filing cabinets, and a wall-mounted master schedule.  \n**E)** **IT & Troubleshooting Corner** – A workstation with diagnostic tools, spare printer parts, and tangled cables.  \n**F)** **Break Room (with a Twist)** – A small kitchenette doubling as an overflow area for misplaced supplies.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A) Receiving & Inventory Zone**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Steel industrial shelving units** (2m tall, 3m wide, labeled A-F).  \n- **Freight scale** (max 500kg, digital display flickering slightly).  \n- **Rolling pallet jack** (handle slightly bent, grease stains on wheels).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed test booklet pallet** (wooden, 120x80cm, labeled \"K-PREP Gr. 3-5 – DO NOT OPEN BEFORE MAY 21\").  \n- **Mismatched shipment** (one box of \"EXPLORE Test Booklets\" mistakenly delivered here; label partially torn).  \n- **Handheld barcode scanner** (low battery warning blinking, left on charging dock but cord unplugged).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Stacks of empty plastic bins** (some cracked, labeled \"RETURN TO WAREHOUSE 12\").  \n- **Clipboard with delivery manifests** (last entry smudged by coffee spill).  \n- **'RECEIVED' stamp and inkpad** (ink drying out, blotchy impressions).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded OSHA poster** (\"LIFT WITH YOUR KNEES!\") peeling at the corners.  \n- **Dusty hard hat** (perched on a shelf, unused).  \n- **Half-empty water cooler** (with a sticky note: \"Out of cups – use mugs from break room\").  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B) Secure Storage Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty keypad-locked door** (display reads \"ENTER 6-DIGIT CODE\").  \n- **Climate-controlled storage cabinets** (glass-fronted, internal temperature display: 18°C).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **ACT test booklets** (in a tamper-evident plastic crate, red \"SECURE\" tape intact).  \n- **Master keycard** (left on a shelf; ID reads \"CUSTODIAN – EMERGENCY ACCESS ONLY\").  \n- **Expired test batches** (box marked \"VOID – SHRED AFTER 6/1\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Dehumidifier** (grinding noise, needs filter change).  \n- **Spare lockbox** (empty, combo lock set to 0-0-0).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Chalkboard with old inventory counts** (partially erased).  \n- **Dent in the wall** (from a careless forklift incident, unrepaired).  \n\n---  \n\n*(Continued similarly for other areas—each with dense, purposeful objects that enable tasks like:*  \n- *Collaborative lifting of heavy test crates.*  \n- *Debugging a misaligned scanner by fetching a spare part from IT.*  \n- *Identifying the correct box among near-identical ones using subtle label differences.*  \n- *Recovering a lost keycard buried under break room clutter.)*  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Test booklet pallet (120kg, 1.5m tall)** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Malfunctioning printer (50kg, awkward shape)** – Needs one agent to steady while another replaces toner.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - *Five nearly identical boxes of \"Algebra II End-of-Course Exams\"*—only one has a **handwritten \"PILOT VERSION\"** sticker and a **slightly torn corner**. Agents must ignore the distractors (e.g., stacked office supplies) to find it.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - *Problem:* A school reports missing test packets.  \n  - *Solution:* Cross-reference the **admin office’s digital log** (showing shipment #4472) with the **physical manifest** (buried under coffee-stained papers), then locate the box in **Sorting Station Bin D**.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Atmosphere Notes:**  \n- The scene thrums with **urgency** (wall clocks count down to shipment deadlines).  \n- **Subtle chaos** (a single test booklet slipped under a desk; an unplugged freezer threatening to spoil biology lab samples).  \n- **Embedded friction** (competing priorities—e.g., IT needs help now, but the secure room just locked automatically).  \n\nThis environment is **ripe for emergent collaboration**, where agents must **navigate physical, digital, and bureaucratic layers** to keep the testing machine running."
