Is there a way to set up purchases without a product list on the Android Market side? Essentially, I want to do what I am allowed to do in most other merchant APIs, send the product name/id/PRICE/etc to the merchant and get back a response from them if the payment went through or not.\n\nI have too many products to manually add each item to the Android Market Publishing area and want to send the user to the in app market request with a custom title, description, and price (most important), and have Android handle that.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nshare|improve this question\nIt sucks right now, It will give you very hard time. Give them time to screw those guys who are project leads of in-app billing because doc is very very vague. They describe every thing about the inner architecture (which usually we don't want to know) and they don't bother to tell the very important information about how it works. They provided an example that really sucks and is very very complicated. They put all the classes under one head Service... and it really sucks in debugging. –  AZ_ Jun 2 '11 at 16:44\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 6 down vote accepted\n\nNo you can't.\n\nThe reason for this is security. Someone could hack your app and add a new product/ change your product prices, but defining them on the market; they would have to hack your app and have your login for the android market.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Digital Black Market Backroom (Tech Underground)*  \n**Core Concept:** A clandestine tech workshop where hackers, counterfeiters, and gray-market vendors collaborate to bypass digital security systems—specifically app store monetization controls. The scene is a chaotic fusion of a server farm, an electronics lab, and an illicit shipping hub, where teams must work together to spoof transactions, forge credentials, and package compromised devices.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Large Objects:** Server racks, shipping crates, and industrial printers require coordinated movement.  \n- **Specialized Roles:** One agent must monitor security systems, another must flash firmware, while a third packages devices—requiring synchronized actions.  \n- **Dynamic Threats:** Random system alerts, thermal overloads, or unexpected inspections force reactive teamwork.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Entry Airlock (Security Buffer)**  \n   - A cramped vestibule with biometric scanners and a metal detector. Walls are lined with confiscated devices in clear evidence lockers.  \n   - **Purpose:** Screening for surveillance devices; agents must disable alarms to let collaborators in.  \n\n2. **Main Workfloor (Electronics Lab)**  \n   - Long steel workbenches under harsh LED strips, cluttered with soldering irons, oscilloscopes, and cracked-open smartphones.  \n   - **Purpose:** Primary workspace for firmware tampering and device cloning.  \n\n3. **Server Closet (Network Hub)**  \n   - A humming, overlocked rack of repurposed gaming PCs with makeshift liquid cooling. Wires snake into the ceiling.  \n   - **Purpose:** Hosts spoofed app store APIs and transaction simulators.  \n\n4. **Packaging Zone (Shipping Dock)**  \n   - A conveyor belt feeds into a industrial shrink-wrapper. Sealed boxes labeled \"FRAGILE: MEDICAL EQUIPMENT\" stack haphazardly.  \n   - **Purpose:** Disguising and shipping hacked devices.  \n\n5. **Breakroom (Social Engineering Hub)**  \n   - A dim lounge with a coffee maker, whiteboards covered in phishing email drafts, and a wall of fake employee badges.  \n   - **Purpose:** Crafting counterfeit identities to bypass app store verifications.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Entry Airlock**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Biometric Terminal (Wall-Mounted)**  \n  - Palm scanner with a flickering red LED. Sticky note on side reads: \"CLEAN SENSOR DAILY - FALSE REJECTS @ 43%\".  \n- **Evidence Lockers (3x, Bolted to Floor)**  \n  - Transparent polycarbonate, each holding a \"confiscated\" device (e.g., a gutted iPhone 14, a Raspberry Pi with snipped GPIO pins).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Jammed Metal Detector**  \n  - Status: *Beeps erratically due to loose wiring*. Requires two agents to stabilize while a third passes through.  \n- **Master Keycard (Hidden)**  \n  - Taped under a loose floor tile near the lockers. Matches the label \"AUTH_OVERRIDE - DO NOT DUPLICATE\".  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Decontamination Spray Bottle**  \n  - 70% isopropyl, half-empty. Label warns: \"EYEWASH STATION OUT OF ORDER\".  \n- **Security Monitor (CRT, Static-Flickering)**  \n  - Shows a laggy feed of the workfloor. A Post-it blocks the corner: \"CAM 3 OFFLINE - FIX BEFORE SHIPMENT\".  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti**  \n  - Scratched into the doorframe: \"TRUST NO OTA UPDATES\".  \n- **Discarded Gloves**  \n  - Nitrile, piled in a cracked hazmat bin. One drifts lazily in a breeze from the AC vent.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Main Workfloor** *(Example – Other areas follow same density)*  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- **Anti-Static Workbench (4m Long)**  \n  - Grounding straps dangle off the edge. Surface stained with flux residue and coffee rings.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **\"Golden Sample\" Device (iPhone 15 Pro, Jailbroken)**  \n  - Connected to a logic analyzer. Screen displays a spoofed \"$0.99\" in-app purchase prompt.  \n- **Firmware Flasher (Arduino Cluster)**  \n  - 12 boards daisy-chained, one blinking ERROR: \"SIGNATURE VERIFY FAIL\".  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient:**  \n- **Tool Cart (Overloaded)**  \n  - Contains a precision screwdriver set (missing T3 bit), a hot-air rework station (set to 420°C), and a jar of \"borrowed\" microSD cards.  \n- **USB Hub (Overheating)**  \n  - Melted smell. One port sparks if a cable is inserted at the wrong angle.  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- **\"Wall of Shame\"**  \n  - Framed rejection emails from app stores, annotated with red Sharpie: \"TRY REF #8821 NEXT TIME\".  \n- **Dust Bunny Colony**  \n  - Huddled under the bench, tangled with stripped wire snippets.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n**Collaborative Transport Example:**  \n- **Server Rack (Network Hub)**  \n  - Weight: 210kg. Requires 3+ agents to lift while a fourth guides the wheels over a raised power cable.  \n\n**Reasoning Challenge Example:**  \n- **Attribute-Based:**  \n  - Among 20 cloned devices, only *one* has the correct spoofed serial (printed in UV ink, detectable under a blacklight pen in the breakroom).  \n- **Tool-Use:**  \n  - The thermal printer (Packaging Zone) jams unless the *specific* lubricant (stored in the airlock) is applied to its rollers.  \n\n**Atmospheric Noise:**  \n- A looping audio track of office chatter plays softly from a hidden speaker—masking real voices during illicit calls.  \n\n---  \n**Final Note:** Every object is a breadcrumb for a potential task chain, and every \"useless\" detail (like the graffitied doorframe) is a red herring to train precision. The scene is a pressure cooker of interdependencies—a perfect sandbox for embodied AI collaboration under duress."
