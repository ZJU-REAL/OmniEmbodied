It seems that my server takes 100ms to launch the PHP script, which seems way too much.\n\nWhat are the ways to speed this up, or understand why the server wastes 100ms?\n\nPS: Here is how I came up with this \"100ms overhead\":\n\nWhen I test the script from my browser, Chrome's developer tools indicate the following average timing :\n\nConnecting : 30ms\nWaiting: 170ms\nReceiving: 50ms\n\nI've then added echo microtime(); to the first and last lines of my script. This shows a difference of 70ms, meaning that the whole script takes 70ms and Apache/PHP add 100ms in \"overhead\" to that.\n\nshare|improve this question\nSince the page is dynamic and user-specific, solutions such as Varnish do not seem relevant to me. –  Eric Nov 19 '12 at 13:58\nHow far is your browser from the server? The speed of light may well be the limiting factor here. –  David Schwartz Nov 19 '12 at 19:06\nHow long does it take to ping your server? I've seen pings in the 100ms range over unreliable WiFi. –  tjameson Nov 20 '12 at 2:58\nI am 200 miles away from the server. But this \"speed of light\" should be in the \"Connecting time\" (30ms). I guess the \"Waiting time\" is the time after the initial hand-shake with the server. i.e. pure overhead, right? –  Eric Nov 20 '12 at 8:18\nIt's definitely one factor in the waiting time. But you pay an additional speed of light penalty any time one side waits for the other. The client won't send the request until it gets the server's response to its attempt to open the connection. The server can't launch the script until it gets the client's request. The client can't shut down the connection until it gets the server's response. And so on. –  David Schwartz Nov 21 '12 at 18:33\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\nBrowse other questions tagged or ask your own question.\n",
  "response": "# **Server Room Crisis: Overloaded Data Center**  \n\n## **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThis is a high-stakes IT server room in a corporate data center during a critical system overload. The scene is a dense, high-tech environment packed with server racks, networking equipment, and diagnostic tools. The core challenge is diagnosing and resolving latency issues in real-time, requiring coordinated multi-agent efforts—server technicians, network engineers, and system admins must collaborate to prevent a cascading system failure.  \n\nThe environment inherently demands collaboration due to:  \n- **Heavy, bulky equipment** requiring team lifting.  \n- **Multi-step diagnostics** where one agent reads logs while another adjusts hardware.  \n- **Time-sensitive troubleshooting** where delays mean escalating failures.  \n\n## **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n1. **Primary Server Cluster (Main Floor)**  \n   - The heart of the data center, dominated by towering server racks with blinking LEDs.  \n   - Humming cooling fans create a constant low-frequency drone.  \n   - Overhead cable trays sag with thick bundles of fiber and ethernet.  \n\n2. **Diagnostic Workstation (Corner Office Nook)**  \n   - A cramped but organized desk with multiple monitors displaying real-time server metrics.  \n   - A whiteboard covered in hastily scribbled network diagrams and error codes.  \n   - A half-empty coffee cup with a sticky note: *\"DO NOT TOUCH – DEBUGGING\"*  \n\n3. **Storage & Backup Unit (Rear Section)**  \n   - A locked cabinet containing backup drives and emergency power supplies.  \n   - A stack of unlabeled hard drives on a trolley, some with \"CORRUPT?\" written in marker.  \n   - A flickering LED panel displaying **\"BACKUP IN PROGRESS – DO NOT POWER OFF\"**  \n\n4. **Network Hub (Wall-Mounted Rack)**  \n   - A tangle of labeled and unlabeled cables feeding into switches and routers.  \n   - A blinking red **\"LATENCY SPIKE DETECTED\"** alert on the main router.  \n   - A crumpled Post-it with **\"PATCH CABLE #B12 FAULTY???\"**  \n\n5. **Tool & Spare Parts Cart (Mobile Unit)**  \n   - A wheeled cart loaded with screwdrivers, spare RAM, thermal paste, and cable testers.  \n   - A clipboard with a checklist: **\"CRITICAL SERVERS – PRIORITY 1\"**  \n   - A scattered pile of loose screws and zip ties.  \n\n## **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Primary Server Cluster**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four 42U server racks**, each weighing ~300kg (requires team lift to move).  \n- **Overhead cooling ducts** with adjustable vents (one stuck partially open).  \n- **Emergency power cutoff switch** behind a red safety cover.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Server #R7-F12** – Displaying **\"CPU OVERLOAD – 98% UTILIZATION\"** on its LCD panel.  \n- **Faulty RAM module** – Partially ejected from slot DIMM3 in Server #R4-A9.  \n- **Unplugged fiber cable** – Labeled **\"MAIN DB BACKUP LINK\"** dangling near the floor.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **KVM switch** with a sticky note: **\"USE MONITOR 3 FOR DEBUG\"**  \n- **Thermal sensor** displaying **\"AISLE TEMP: 28°C (WARNING)\"**  \n- **Spare rack screws** in a small magnetic tray.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded OSHA safety poster** (\"LIFT WITH YOUR LEGS!\").  \n- **Dusty \"Employee of the Month\" certificate** from 2018.  \n- **Empty energy drink cans** in a recycling bin.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Diagnostic Workstation**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **L-shaped desk** with three 27\" monitors mounted on adjustable arms.  \n- **Ergonomic chair** with a torn mesh backrest.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Main terminal** running **`htop`** showing runaway PHP processes.  \n- **USB debug dongle** labeled **\"APC CACHE TEST\"** plugged into port #3.  \n- **Printed error log** with **\"100ms LAG – CHECK NETWORK ROUTING\"** highlighted.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label maker** with half-used tape cartridge.  \n- **External HDD** humming softly (LED blinking green).  \n- **Wireless keyboard** with sticky \"W\" and \"Ctrl\" keys.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Keep Calm and Reboot\"** novelty mug.  \n- **Stack of outdated IT manuals** (*Apache 2.2 Optimization Guide*).  \n- **Dying office plant** (brown tips, labeled **\"WATER ME?\"**).  \n\n---  \n\n## **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Server Rack (300kg, 2m tall)** – Requires two agents to safely maneuver.  \n- **Backup Generator (500kg, on wheels but locked)** – Needs a key (hidden in the workstation drawer) and team push to relocate.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five identical-looking fiber cables**, only one has a **blue stress-relief sleeve** and a **tiny \"PRIORITY\" label**—this is the critical link needing reconnection.  \n  - The **faulty RAM module** is the only one with a **scratched heatsink** and **slightly misaligned latch**.  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **locked backup cabinet** (requires keycard).  \n  - **Solution:** The **keycard** is under the workstation keyboard, but a **second agent** must hold the door open while another swipes it.  \n\n### **Dynamic State Changes**  \n- The **overheating server** will **auto-shutdown in 5 minutes** if not fixed.  \n- The **network switch** randomly **drops packets** unless reset—but doing so disconnects the debug terminal.  \n\n---  \n\nThis scene is a **living puzzle**, where every object has weight, purpose, and interactivity. Agents must **communicate, delegate, and act under pressure** to prevent a total system crash."
