It works like this\n\n(1..5).each_cons(3) {|n| p n}\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n[2, 3, 4]\n[3, 4, 5]\n\nI would like to do this in C#. LINQ would be nice.\n\nThe following does something similar but it loops one to many and it's also hardcoded to return only two elements\n\nvar cons = ints.Select((o, i) =>\n            new int[]{ ints[i], i == ints.Length - 1 ? 0 : ints[i + 1] });\n\nIt would be nice if it could be created as an iterator over the original array instead of having to create a lot of arrays.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 9 down vote accepted\n\nTry the following\n\nvar ints = Enumerable.Range(1, 3).Select(x => Enumerable.Range(x, 3));\n\nThis will return an IEnumerable<IEnumerable<int>> with the specified values. You can add the .ToArray expression at any point to get it into an array if that's the intent (can't tell if that's whatthe [] mean in ruby)\n\nshare|improve this answer\n+1 I use statements like this all the time –  Adam Ralph Jan 11 '11 at 17:24\nNice and I don't actually need to do it over unordered ranges/arrays. Not right now anyway. –  Jonas Elfström Jan 11 '11 at 17:25\nAwesome for int; no good for generic \"n elements\". –  Jay Jan 11 '11 at 19:14\n@Jay: Actually is good for generic too. You just need something that generates a T from an int, then with a simple Select the job is done. –  digEmAll Jan 11 '11 at 22:57\n\nYou can create an extension method that achieves it in this way:\n\n    public static IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> each_cons<T>(this IEnumerable<T> enumerable, int length)\n        for (int i = 0; i < enumerable.Count() - length + 1; i++)\n            yield return enumerable.Skip(i).Take(length);\n\nConsume it:\n\nvar ints = Enumerable.Range(1, 7).each_cons(3);\nshare|improve this answer\nIf the enumerable is some kind of linked list, wouldn't the Skip(i) get slower by each iteration then? –  Jonas Elfström Jan 11 '11 at 17:46\n@Jonas This is actually extremely fast -- between 150 and 250 times faster than the head/tail implementation you'd been using in the previous extension method you posted, and using a LinkedList<int> actually makes it significantly faster. –  Jay Jan 11 '11 at 18:59\nHow did you measure that? I did some simple StopWatch tests with lists of 100000 numbers and though mine was slower it was only 12ms against 15ms. –  Jonas Elfström Jan 11 '11 at 22:55\n@Jonas Don't forget to call ToList() or ToArray() on both the inner and outer IEnumerable<T>. Using the yield keyword means that execution is deferred -- there is no enumeration until the values are requested/used, but you can force evaluation by creating a list or array. –  Jay Jan 12 '11 at 0:51\nI thought I did that but I did not. Now that I did I see the HUGE speed difference. –  Jonas Elfström Jan 12 '11 at 8:27\n\nHere's a generic extension method that turned out to be way to complicated for my current use case but it seems to work.\n\nstatic class EnumerableExtension\n    public static IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> EachCons<T>(this IEnumerable<T> sequence, int cons)\n        for (IEnumerable<T> head = sequence.Take(cons), tail = sequence.Skip(1);\n             head.Count() == cons; head = tail.Take(cons), tail = tail.Skip(1))\n             yield return head;\n\nUse Jay's implementation instead. It's MUCH faster. I just left this one here because it's mentioned in Jay's answer.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Algorithmic Assembly Line\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-tech **modular robotics assembly line** where autonomous agents must collaboratively assemble, inspect, and debug custom-built computing machines. The factory is divided into **specialized workstations**, each handling a stage of the production process—from raw material intake to final quality control.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy components** require coordinated lifting.  \n- **Precision tasks** (e.g., wiring, calibration) demand multiple agents for alignment.  \n- **Dynamic troubleshooting**—errors in one station cascade, requiring rapid cross-team intervention.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe factory floor is arranged in a **U-shaped assembly line**, with conveyor belts connecting stations. Lighting is **industrial LED**, casting harsh white light with occasional flickers. The hum of machinery is punctuated by pneumatic hisses and robotic beeps.  \n\n#### **Areas:**  \n1. **Material Intake Bay** – Unpacking and sorting raw components.  \n2. **Circuit Assembly Station** – Precision soldering and chip placement.  \n3. **Mechanical Assembly Station** – Frames, actuators, and structural assembly.  \n4. **Testing & Debugging Bay** – Diagnostics and error correction.  \n5. **Packaging & Shipping** – Sealing and labeling finished units.  \n6. **Control Hub** – Central monitoring terminal with live diagnostics.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Material Intake Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty conveyor belt (3m long, 1.5m wide, 300kg load capacity)** feeding into the factory.  \n- **Steel sorting racks (2m tall, 10 compartments each)** for categorizing incoming parts.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed shipping crates (80x60x50cm, 25kg each, labeled \"IC Chips – FRAGILE\")** needing unpacking.  \n- **Component scanner (red LED indicator, touchscreen interface, occasional calibration drift)** for verifying part authenticity.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Hydraulic pallet jack (cap. 500kg, controls slightly sticky)** for moving crates.  \n- **Label printer (out of toner, blinking \"REPLACE CARTRIDGE\" error)** for tagging sorted items.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded OSHA safety poster (\"LIFT WITH YOUR KNEES!\")** peeling off the wall.  \n- **Discarded packing foam chunks** littering the floor near a dented trash bin.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Circuit Assembly Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Anti-static workbench (2m x 1m, grounded copper surface)** with built-in magnification lenses.  \n- **Precision robotic arm (locked in \"standby\" mode, awaiting calibration)** for micro-soldering.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Defective circuit board (burnt smell, visibly charred resistor at position B7)** marked for rework.  \n- **Tub of conductive adhesive (half-empty, viscosity thickening)** for emergency repairs.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Microscope (10x-40x zoom, left eyepiece misaligned)** for inspecting solder joints.  \n- **Component trays (labeled \"RESISTORS – 10Ω ±5%\")** sorted by type but slightly disorganized.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Engineer’s coffee mug (\"#1 Debugger\")** repurposed as a holder for tiny screws.  \n- **Whiteboard with half-erased scribbles:** \"CHECK VOLTAGE REGULATOR BEFORE FINAL TEST.\"  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Mechanical Assembly Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Hydraulic press (500kg force, safety interlock engaged)** for frame alignment.  \n- **Tool wall (pegboard with outlined shapes for missing wrenches)** partially disorganized.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Misaligned actuator arm (stuck at 45°, requires two agents to realign)** blocking the conveyor.  \n- **Torque wrench (calibration sticker expired, slight drift in readings)** for critical bolt-tightening.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Pneumatic screwdriver (hissing air leak, still operational)** for rapid fastening.  \n- **Lubricant dispenser (clogged nozzle, needs cleaning)** for joint maintenance.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Dusty \"Employee of the Month\" plaque (dated 3 years ago).**  \n- **Scattered rubber gaskets** under the workbench from a previous rushed job.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **4. Testing & Debugging Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Diagnostic terminal (triple monitors, one flickering intermittently)** running automated test suites.  \n- **Vibration test chamber (door slightly misaligned, needs force to close)** for stress-testing.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Failing unit (error code E1024: \"Memory Leak Detected\")** stuck in reboot loop.  \n- **Logic analyzer (probes tangled, missing Probe #3)** for tracing signal faults.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Thermal camera (battery low, auto-shutdown in 10 min)** for overheating checks.  \n- **Stack of QA checklists (last one incomplete, pen missing)** on a clipboard.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"DO NOT TOUCH – TEST IN PROGRESS\" sign** dangling by one corner.  \n- **Half-eaten energy bar wrapper** crumpled near the keyboard.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The hydraulic press (500kg, 3m long)** requires two agents to operate safely (one to position the frame, another to engage the press).  \n- **The misaligned actuator arm (60kg, awkward grip points)** needs synchronized lifting to avoid damaging the assembly line.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **chemical bottles** on the shelf, only **one (blue cap, handwritten \"CORROSIVE – DO NOT MIX\")** is hazardous. Nearby, a **decorative blue glass paperweight** adds perceptual noise.  \n- **Compound Tool Use:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **locked diagnostic terminal** (biometric scanner, no override).  \n  - **Solution:** The **engineer’s misplaced keycard** is buried under a stack of manuals in the **Control Hub**.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Notes:**  \nThis environment is **dense with potential failures, tools, and distractions**, ensuring that agents must **collaborate, reason precisely, and adapt dynamically** to succeed. Every object has **purpose, history, and state**, making the scene feel **lived-in and operationally complex**.  \n\nWould you like any refinements or additional layers of detail?"
