  "response": "### **Scene Concept: Emergency Field Hospital at a Stadium Post-Stampede**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nInspired by the tragic stampede at a New Year's fireworks show, this scene is a **makeshift emergency field hospital** set up in the concourse of a large stadium. The environment is chaotic but organized, with medical personnel, volunteers, and security forces working under extreme pressure to triage and treat hundreds of injured civilians—many of them children.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **High-stakes urgency** demands coordination between medics, logistics teams, and security.  \n- **Limited resources** (beds, supplies, personnel) require dynamic task prioritization.  \n- **Complex patient flow** necessitates crowd control, rapid diagnosis, and transport logistics.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe field hospital is divided into key zones:  \n\n1. **Triage Entrance (Main Concourse)** – Crowded with incoming casualties, guarded by police, with a bottleneck at the entrance due to limited space.  \n2. **Acute Trauma Bays (Converted Concessions Area)** – Where critical patients receive immediate stabilization.  \n3. **Pediatric Recovery Zone (VIP Lounge)** – A quieter area with smaller cots for children.  \n4. **Supply Depot (Storage Rooms)** – Overstuffed with half-unpacked crates of medical supplies.  \n5. **Communications Hub (Press Booth)** – Where administrators coordinate with ambulances and external hospitals.  \n6. **Morgue Tent (Back Hallway)** – A grim, cordoned-off area with temporary refrigeration units.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Triage Entrance (Main Concourse)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Metal barricades (2.5m tall, bolted to the floor)** – Funnel incoming patients into a single-file line.  \n- **Folding registration desks (3, each with a laptop on battery power)** – Staffed by exhausted volunteers.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Triage tags (color-coded: red/yellow/green/black)** – Some scattered on the floor, needing reorganization.  \n- **Portable defibrillator (locked in a case, requires security key)** – Mounted on the wall near the entrance.  \n- **Stretchers (4, two broken wheels, one with a snapped handle)** – Leaned against a wall haphazardly.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Hand sanitizer stations (3, one empty, two low)** – Mounted on support poles.  \n- **Emergency lighting (flickering in one corner)** – Casts uneven shadows.  \n- **Megaphone (battery dying, voice distorted)** – Held by a security guard.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Discarded fireworks flyers (\"Celebrate Peace!\")** – Trampled underfoot.  \n- **Lost shoes (children’s sandals, one adult sneaker)** – Near the entrance.  \n- **Graffiti on the walls (\"Unity 2014\" crossed out)** – Faintly visible under fresh scuff marks.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Acute Trauma Bays (Converted Concessions Area)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Stainless steel concession counters (repurposed as surgical tables)** – Two have bloodstains hastily wiped off.  \n- **IV pole clusters (some missing hooks, others tangled with tubing)** – Near each bed.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Portable ventilator (1, low battery alarm beeping intermittently)** – Requires a new power source.  \n- **Suture kits (some missing forceps, others unsterilized)** – In a plastic bin labeled \"URGENT.\"  \n- **Oxygen tanks (2 full, 1 nearly empty, 1 regulator broken)** – Stacked near the entrance.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Blood pressure cuffs (some torn, others functional)** – Hanging on a rolling cart.  \n- **Biohazard bins (overflowing with gauze and gloves)** – Needs replacement.  \n- **Clipboards with patient charts (some illegible, others incomplete)** – Piled on a folding chair.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Concession menus (\"Hot Dogs $5\")** – Still taped to the wall, partly torn.  \n- **A child’s drawing (smudged, found on the floor)** – Depicts fireworks.  \n- **Cracked mirror behind the counter** – Reflects the chaos.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Oxygen tanks (full, 150kg each)** – Requires two people to safely move.  \n- **Unconscious patient on stretcher (90kg, must be stabilized during transport)** – Needs coordination to avoid dropping.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five identical IV bags**, only one has **a handwritten \"Pediatric Dose\" note** and is **half-empty**—critical for a child's treatment. Other bags are misplaced near **discarded snack wrappers**, adding visual noise.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** A **locked medication cabinet** (requires a key kept in the **Communications Hub**).  \n  - **Solution:** Key is **hidden under a stack of radio manuals**, requiring agents to search intelligently.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes on Atmosphere & Realism**  \nThe scene is **visually dense**, with **layers of sensory detail** (flickering lights, distant sirens, the metallic scent of blood). Non-critical objects (lost shoes, graffiti) **add emotional weight** while also serving as perceptual distractors. The **limited resources** and **broken equipment** force agents to **improvise solutions**, making collaboration essential.  \n\nThis environment is **ripe for dynamic tasks**:  \n- **Medical:** Prioritizing patients, restocking supplies, fixing equipment.  \n- **Logistical:** Clearing bottlenecks, coordinating transport.  \n- **Security:** Managing crowd panic, securing restricted areas.  \n\nEvery object has **purpose**, every space has **history**, and every problem has **multiple possible solutions**—some requiring teamwork, others requiring sharp reasoning."
