An early victim of the air mass was the city of Chicago, which recorded a record low of −27 °F (−33 °C), coupled with 25 miles per hour (40 km/h) winds to produce a wind chill of −77 °F (−61 °C), also never recorded before. The wind chill calculation was adjusted in 2001, which would make the value about −60 °F (−51 °C) on the new scale.[3] St. Louis saw a low of −18 °F (−28 °C). Pittsburgh woke up that morning to find a low of −18 °F (−28 °C), the coldest morning since 1899.[4] In Cincinnati, the morning temperature of −21 °F (−29 °C) tied for the fourth-lowest minimum temperature in the city's history, outdone by a cold mass the year before and a blizzard in 1977.[5] Cleveland fell to −18 °F (−28 °C), which was at the time a record.[6] Memphis recorded a low of −4 °F (−20 °C), setting a record low for that day. The coldest temperature in the contiguous states on Jan. 21 was −24 °F (−31 °C), in the unlikely location of Akron, Ohio.[7]\n\nThe mass moved east and south during the day on January 20, resulting in frigid air for most of the Eastern Seaboard starting on the morning of January 21. New York City's Central Park recorded a low of −2 °F (−19 °C), breaking that date's record.[8] Washington National Airport set a record of −4 °F (−20 °C) for the morning of January 21 and a record low for the prior date of −2 °F (−19 °C).[9] It was the Southern United States that felt the biggest brunt, unaccustomed as they are to the Northern states' winter air. Roanoke, Virginia set a record low of −11 °F (−24 °C), and the campus of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Tennessee, recorded a record low of −24 °F (−31 °C).[1] Tennessee's state capital, Nashville, dropped to −17 °F (−27 °C), while all-time records were set well into interior sections of the deep South, such as −5 °F (−21 °C) in Charlotte,[1] −6 °F (−21 °C) in Macon, Georgia,[1] 7 °F (−14 °C) in Jacksonville, Florida,[1] and 10 °F (−12 °C) in Gainesville, Florida[10] (coldest since 6 °F (−14 °C) in 1899). Atlanta saw a low of −8 °F (−22 °C), setting a record for the month of January and for the 20th century, missing by just one degree the all-time record (since 1879) set in February 1899.[11] Even Miami, whose average low in late January is 60 °F (16 °C), recorded a low of 34 °F (1 °C) on the 21st and 30 °F (−1 °C) on the 22nd, both record lows for the date, the latter being one of only 10 times the city has been that cold since 1895.[12][13]\n\nFerocious cold in February 1985 set two more state record lows in the Mountain West. Utah's −69 °F (−56 °C) was the second-coldest temperature ever recorded in the \"lower 48\" states, just above Montana's record of −70 °F (−57 °C) in 1954. Colorado's −61 °F (−52 °C) broke the old record of −60 °F (−51 °C), also on February 1.\n\nImpact and aftermath[edit]\n\nThe cold wave brought human fatalities, deaths of wild and domesticated animals, crop losses, and infrastructure damage to homes, municipality and industrial sites. At least 126 deaths were blamed on the cold snap.[14] Some 90 percent of the citrus crop in Florida was destroyed in what the state called the \"Freeze of the Century.\"[15] Florida's citrus industry suffered $1.2 billion in losses ($2.3 billion in 2009 dollars) as a result of the inclement weather, which killed nearly every citrus tree in central Florida, and forced the industry permanently into southern Florida.[16] The public inauguration of President Ronald Reagan for his second term was held in the Capitol Rotunda instead of outside due to the cold weather, canceling the inaugural parade in the process. (Because Inauguration Day fell on a Sunday, Reagan took a private oath on January 20 and the semi-public oath on January 21.)[17]\n\nU.S. state record lows set in 1985[edit]\n\n\n  • Colorado: −61 °F (−52 °C) Feb 1\n  • North Carolina: −34 °F (−37 °C) Jan 21 atop Mount Mitchell\n  • South Carolina: −19 °F (−28 °C) Jan 21\n  • Utah: −69 °F (−56 °C) Feb 1\n  • Virginia: −30 °F (−34 °C) Jan 22\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: Emergency Winter Crisis Response Center**  \n*(Inspired by the 1985 Arctic Outbreak)*  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA state-of-the-art **Emergency Winter Crisis Response Center** has been hastily activated in a repurposed industrial warehouse to coordinate disaster relief efforts during a historic polar vortex event. The center is a chaotic, high-stakes environment where government officials, meteorologists, utility workers, and medical personnel collaborate to manage power outages, stranded citizens, agricultural losses, and infrastructure failures.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Large, heavy objects** (generators, medical supply crates) require coordinated transport.  \n- **Complex workflows** (data analysis, emergency dispatch, medical triage) necessitate role specialization.  \n- **Time-sensitive decision-making** forces agents to share information dynamically.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe warehouse is divided into six key zones:  \n\n1. **Main Command Hub** – Central workstation with live weather maps, emergency hotlines, and a large situation board.  \n2. **Meteorology & Forecasting Station** – Banks of computers analyzing satellite data, surrounded by printouts of historical cold wave patterns.  \n3. **Medical Triage & Supply Depot** – Cots, IV bags, and emergency blankets stacked haphazardly; a refrigerated unit holds temperature-sensitive medicines.  \n4. **Utility Repair Coordination** – Workbenches strewn with broken power grid components; a whiteboard tracks repair crew deployments.  \n5. **Citizen Response & Communications** – A bank of ringing phones, clipboards with handwritten distress calls, and a wall map with pins marking stranded households.  \n6. **Storage & Logistics Bay** – Pallets of bottled water, MREs, and diesel generators awaiting distribution.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Command Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **12-foot-wide modular situation board** with magnetic markers, weather overlays, and a red \"CRITICAL\" stamp on the latest cold front projection.  \n- A **central hexagonal table** with six networked terminals, each displaying different emergency dashboards.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Emergency Broadcast Console** (state: *active/alarm mode*) – A red button labeled \"STATEWIDE ALERT.\"  \n- **Physical map of the region** with pins marking power outages (some loose pins scattered nearby).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Overflowing paper tray** with faxes from county offices.  \n- **Three coffee makers** (state: *two empty, one half-full of stale coffee*).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A framed photo of the governor** slightly askew on the wall.  \n- **A crumpled \"Winter Preparedness\" pamphlet** on the floor.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Meteorology & Forecasting Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Three high-end weather tracking PCs** (state: *one displaying a frozen graph*).  \n- **A large rolling whiteboard** covered in differential equations.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A printed report** titled *\"1985 vs. Current Vortex Patterns\"* (state: *highlighted but missing page 3*).  \n- **A manually adjusted barometer** (state: *needle stuck at 980 hPa*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A stack of floppy disks** labeled *\"Backup – DO NOT ERASE.\"*  \n- **A wall-mounted analog clock** (state: *stopped at 3:17 AM*).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A novelty \"World’s Best Meteorologist\" mug** collecting dust.  \n- **A yellowed newspaper clipping** of the 1985 freeze taped to the side of a monitor.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **4. Utility Repair Coordination** *(Example of Collaborative Affordance)*  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A heavy-duty workbench** with **a 150kg transformer prototype** (requires two agents to lift).  \n- **A pegboard wall** holding **specialized tools** (state: *several missing, leaving empty hooks*).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A locked breaker box** (state: *requires keycard from Command Hub*).  \n- **A half-assembled portable generator** (state: *missing its voltage regulator, last seen in Storage Bay*).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A ringing landline phone** (state: *caller ID shows \"County Maintenance\"*).  \n- **A grease-stained work manual** opened to *\"Emergency Repairs in Sub-Zero Conditions.\"*  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A broken \"Safety First\" sign** propped against a wall.  \n- **A faded union sticker** peeling off a toolbox.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The 150kg transformer** in Utility Repair requires two agents to move due to **weight and awkward shape (1.5m x 0.8m).**  \n- **A pallet of emergency water bottles (500kg, 2m x 1.5m)** in Storage Bay needs forklift operation (one agent drives, another guides).  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five identical-looking circuit breakers**, only **one has a red \"HIGH VOLTAGE\" sticker and a scratched-off serial number**—critical for repair.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** To restore power, agents must:  \n  1. **Find the breaker box keycard** (hidden in a desk drawer in Command Hub).  \n  2. **Retrieve the missing voltage regulator** (buried under MRE boxes in Storage Bay).  \n  3. **Align the transformer correctly** (referencing a diagram in the grease-stained manual).  \n\n#### **Distractors & Realism**  \n- **A decorative blue glass paperweight** near the circuit breakers could be mistaken for a critical component.  \n- **A non-functional \"Emergency Switch\"** on the wall is labeled but disconnected.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis environment is **dense, dynamic, and primed for emergent collaboration.** The combination of **heavy objects, layered tool dependencies, and ambient noise** ensures that agents must **communicate, specialize, and problem-solve under pressure**—just like a real crisis response team.  \n\nWould you like any refinements or additional layers of detail?"
