This attitude of \"we, the old men in power know better than you ignorant childen\" which is demeaning at best and leads to catastrophe at worst.\n\nComment: Crappy code is the undoing of Computer Science (Score 2) 583\n\nby ghostunit (#35467428) Attached to: CS Profs Debate Role of Math In CS Education\nI dislike this kind of dissing of math in favor of praising a \"hands-on\" approach to programming.\n\nI don't know if developing math skills helps with what is mostly a craft such as programming, but I think that encouraging an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the programming community will only lead to an even greater abundance of insultingly crappy code that consumes more effort and causes more frustration than any other factor in the industry.\n\nComment: Re:A piece of forgotten history: (Score 1) 431\n\nby ghostunit (#35457694) Attached to: 8.8 Earthquake Near Japanese Coast\nyeah, I found the quote: \"(Tokyo Governor Ishihara) referring to Chinese using the derogatory pre-war word \"sankokujin\" (third-country person) and calling for the SDF to protect Japanese from marauding foreigners in the event of a massive Tokyo earthquake, Tokyo Governor Ishihara has become infamous amongst the foreign community for his reactionary policies and inflammatory comments. \"\n\nComment: Re:The choice for elderly Japanese is simple (Score 1) 200\n\nby ghostunit (#35109500) Attached to: Japan's Elderly Nix Robot Helpers\nAs for the level of Japanese fluency, I see it more as an excuse than a legitimate reason to put yet another barrier between their country and the rest of the world. You don't see Mexican immigrants coming in with English degrees, yet they are oftenly praised for their hard-working attitude and good work output.\n\nAs I said, the elderly Japanese better realize they don't really have a whole lotta options here. Robots? that's a pipe-dream and everyone knows it. The Japanese are just in denial, and the longer they keep it up, the longer it's gonna hurt them.\n\nComment: Re:Oblig.

For example, Iodine deficiency is perhaps the most cost effective human capital fix there is. Yet the Gates foundation has only given a few million to that cause as far as I can tell. Vaccines are sexy, saving children is sexy, makes your altruism feel good. Iodine in salt - not so sexy, no discernible results for 20+ years, no great feel good effect.\n\nOh awesome - Nikolas Kristof wrote about it : here\n\nUnfortunately, the most cost-effective aid interventions tend to be the kind that are incremental and save only a small proportion of lives—and are thus least satisfying to the giver. For instance, my wife, Sheryl WuDunn, and I have recently published a new book, Half the Sky, arguing that educating and empowering women is the most effective way to fight global poverty and extremism. In the book we call on the U.S. government to adopt a program to help poor countries iodize their salt. Right now, about one-third of families in poor countries don't get enough iodine, and the result is not so much goiters as diminished intellectual capacity. Iodine is essential to brain formation for a fetus in the first trimester, and if a mother lacks iodine her child may end up mentally retarded. More commonly, children in such areas lose 10 to 15 IQ points, with girls particularly affected for reasons that aren't fully understood. This is a lifelong intelligence deficit and a significant burden on poor countries, and it can be resolved very cheaply; iodizing salt costs a couple of pennies per person per year.\n\nStudies have suggested that iodizing salt brings real economic returns of nine times the cost—and yet we don't do it. The reason is, I think, that the results are statistical, not visible. You can never look at a child afterwards and say, \"This girl would have been retarded if it weren't for iodized salt.\" All you can do is note that retardation rates fall and that, a decade later, school performance improves significantly.\n\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *High-Security Crisis Management Lab*  \n**Core Concept:** A multidisciplinary emergency response lab, hastily assembled to analyze and mitigate a nuclear contamination crisis (inspired by Fukushima drone footage debates and iodine deficiency discussions). The lab integrates robotics, chemistry, and data analysis, with an urgent, tense atmosphere.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Large Objects:** Radiation shielding, bulky sensor arrays.  \n- **Specialized Roles:** Chemists, roboticists, analysts must collaborate.  \n- **Time Pressure:** Parallel tasks (e.g., sample analysis while drones scout).  \n\n---  \n### **Spatial Layout**  \nA repurposed industrial warehouse with:  \n1. **Drone Operations Hub** – Live feeds from Fukushima-like zone.  \n2. **Contamination Analysis Bay** – Fume hoods, spectrometers.  \n3. **Robotics Workshop** – Disassembled repair drones, tools.  \n4. **Data Fusion Center** – Servers, maps with radiation overlays.  \n5. **Decontamination Airlock** – UV lights, hazmat suit racks.  \n6. **Break Area (Neglected)** – Empty coffee pots, stale snacks.  \n\n---  \n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Drone Operations Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- Steel workbench (2m x 1m, bolted to floor) with 6x cracked touchscreens showing drone feeds.  \n- Overhead rail system for drone battery swaps (1x dangling charger, wires exposed).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **\"Falcon-9\" Drone (critical)**  \n  - State: *Landing gear jammed* (bent strut).  \n  - Properties: 18kg, 1.2m wingspan, requires two agents to lift safely.  \n  - Attached: *Soil sampler module* (needs sterilization).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Battery cart (4x slots: 2x charged, 1x overheating, 1x empty).  \n- Calibration target (checkerboard plate, smudged with dirt).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- Graffiti on wall: *\"DATA = TRUTH\"* in shaky spray paint.  \n- Pile of outdated flight manuals (2018 editions, coffee-stained).  \n\n---  \n#### **2. Contamination Analysis Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- Lead-lined fume hood (3m wide, left door stuck 10cm open).  \n- Industrial freezer (–80°C, alarm blinking \"DOOR AJAR\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Iodine-131 Sample Tray**  \n  - Properties: *Sealed vial (blue cap) vs. unsealed (red cap, leaking absorbent pad).*  \n  - Critical detail: *Only blue-cap vials fit spectrometer rack.*  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient:**  \n- Centrifuge (error code: \"RPM MISMATCH\").  \n- Glovebox (left glove torn at fingertips).  \n\n**d. Background:**  \n- Yellowed *\"RADIATION HAZARD\"* poster (1980s vintage).  \n- Someone’s lunch: *Bento box with untouched rice (fork stuck upright).*  \n\n---  \n#### **3. Robotics Workshop**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- Hydraulic repair lift (2-ton capacity, hydraulic fluid leak near base).  \n- Parts bins (labeled *\"MOTORS – UNTESTED\"*).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Broken Manipulator Arm**  \n  - State: *Gripper stuck closed* due to stripped servo (P/N #A7X-22).  \n  - Nearby: *Mismatched screwdriver set* (Phillips #3 fits servo cover).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient:**  \n- Soldering station (iron left on, tip charred).  \n- 3D printer (mid-job: *half-finished gear*).  \n\n**d. Background:**  \n- *\"ROBOTS ≠ PEOPLE\"* sticky note on monitor.  \n- Pile of *failed prints* (melted plastic blobs).  \n\n---  \n### **Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Example:**  \n- **Lead Shielding Plate** (3m x 2m, 300kg) – Requires 3+ agents to maneuver around spectrometer.  \n\n**Reasoning Challenge:**  \n- **Find the Corrosive Bottle**  \n  - Among 12 chemical bottles, identify:  \n    - *Unique:* Glass bottle, handwritten *\"ACID – 12% HNO₃\"*, cracked lid.  \n    - *Distractor:* Decorative blue glass flask (non-hazardous) nearby.  \n\n**Compound Tool-Use Problem:**  \n- **Problem:** Freezer alarm (\"DOOR AJAR\") due to *ice jam*.  \n- **Solution:**  \n  1. *Hairdryer* (in break area, under newspapers).  \n  2. Requires *extension cord* (tangled in drone hub).  \n\n---  \n**Atmosphere Notes:**  \n- Constant *hum* of servers, occasional *drone prop whine*.  \n- Flickering *LED strip* above robotics bench.  \n- *Ozone smell* from overloaded electronics.  \n\nThis environment is *dense* with tasks requiring coordination, attribute-based reasoning, and tool chaining—all while navigating realistic clutter and time pressure."
