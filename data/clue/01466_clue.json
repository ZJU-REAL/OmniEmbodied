  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Corporate Office & Recruitment Center*  \nThis is a bustling, mid-sized corporate office serving as both a recruitment hub and a daily operations center for Omni SAN Diego—a fictional biotech firm specializing in sustainable urban agriculture. The space is designed to accommodate two primary functions:  \n1. **Job Recruitment & Interviews:** A dedicated area for evaluating candidates through practical tests (e.g., assembling lab equipment, solving logistical puzzles).  \n2. **Day-to-Day Operations:** Researchers, HR staff, and logistics coordinators work side by side, creating organic opportunities for collaboration (e.g., moving sensitive equipment, coordinating sample deliveries).  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- Heavy lab equipment requires teamwork to transport.  \n- Time-sensitive tasks (e.g., processing candidate tests while managing live experiments) demand role specialization.  \n- Security protocols (keycard-locked areas, sample tracking) introduce access dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Reception & Waiting Area**  \n   - *Purpose:* First impression for candidates; security checkpoint.  \n   - *Feel:* Sterile but welcoming, with live plants (Omni’s product) on display.  \n   - *Key Features:* Glass walls, a reception desk with a biometric scanner, seating with embedded chargers.  \n\n2. **Collaborative Testing Lab**  \n   - *Purpose:* Practical skills assessment for job applicants.  \n   - *Feel:* High-energy, slightly chaotic—half lab, half obstacle course.  \n   - *Key Features:* Adjustable workstations, timed task boards, emergency stop buttons.  \n\n3. **HR Office Cluster**  \n   - *Purpose:* Interview debriefs and candidate evaluation.  \n   - *Feel:* Professional but personalized (family photos, quirky mugs).  \n   - *Key Features:* Glass-walled offices, a shared printer, whiteboards with candidate rubrics.  \n\n4. **Logistics & Shipping Hub**  \n   - *Purpose:* Handling sensitive biotech samples and equipment.  \n   - *Feel:* Industrial yet organized, with climate-control warnings.  \n   - *Key Features:* Pallet jack, refrigerated lockers, a wall-sized delivery manifest screen.  \n\n5. **Break Room / \"Culture Zone\"**  \n   - *Purpose:* Showcasing company culture (and caffeine access).  \n   - *Feel:* Lived-in, with mismatched chairs and a popcorn machine.  \n   - *Key Features:* Bulletin board with event photos, a broken Keurig (out of order sign), snack stash with a \"DO NOT TOUCH – LAB PARTY FRIDAY\" note.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Reception & Waiting Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- *Reception Desk:* 3m long, matte black surface, built-in touchscreen for check-ins. A small *\"Omni SAN Diego – Growing Futures\"* plaque.  \n- *Biometric Scanner:* Wall-mounted, with a flickering green \"ready\" light.  \n- *Seating Area:* Three modular sofas (dark blue, slightly stained), each with USB-C ports.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- *Visitor Log Tablet:* Requires receptionist approval to proceed. Currently displaying *\"Error: Network Unavailable\"*.  \n- *Sample Display Case:* Locked, containing a hydroponic tomato plant under grow lights. Label: *\"PROTOTYPE 9B – DO NOT OPEN\"*.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- *Security Camera:* Ceiling-mounted, with a loose wire dangling.  \n- *Brochure Rack:* Half-empty, with crumpled *\"Careers at Omni\"* pamphlets.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- *Fake Plant:* Dusty, with a *\"Water Me!\"* sticky note (ironic—it’s plastic).  \n- *Wall Art:* A pixelated mural of San Diego made from recycled circuit boards.  \n\n---  \n*(Continued for other areas—here’s a snippet of the **Testing Lab** for brevity.)*  \n\n#### **2. Collaborative Testing Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- *Central Workbench:* Steel, 2.5m x 1.2m, bolted to the floor. Scratched surface with etched measurement markings.  \n- *Equipment Cart:* On wheels, loaded with microscopes (one missing an eyepiece).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- *Timed Task Board:* Digital display counting down from 15:00. Current task: *\"Assemble Nutrient Dispenser – Check Figure 3\"*.  \n- *\"Broken\" Centrifuge:* Power switch jammed; requires two people to tilt and reset the circuit breaker.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- *Spill Kit:* Wall-mounted, seal intact (unused).  \n- *Tool Wall:* Wrenches hung in outlined shapes, one slot empty.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- *Graffiti:* Tiny *\"Nice try :)\"* carved into a stool leg.  \n- *Old Coffee Cup:* Labeled *\"Biohazard\"* as a joke, half-full of pens.  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n**Collaborative Transportation Example:**  \n- The *refrigerated sample locker* (Logistics Hub) weighs 200kg when full; its wheels are stiff, requiring one agent to steer while another pushes.  \n\n**Reasoning Example:**  \n- *Attribute-Based:* Among five near-identical *\"Candidate Test Kits\"* (Testing Lab), only one has a *red stripe* and *missing pipette*—critical for the timed task. A decorative red ribbon on the wall adds perceptual noise.  \n- *Compound Tool-Use:* The *locked display case* (Reception) needs a keycard held by the HR manager (who’s in a meeting). The keycard is in their *\"World’s Best Boss\"* mug (HR Office).  \n\n**Purposeful \"Noise\":**  \n- A *stack of resumes* (HR Office) is mostly blank, but one has a coffee ring—useless, but adds realism.  \n- The *printer* (HR Cluster) has a jammed tray (non-critical but tempting to fix).  \n\n---  \n**Final Note:** This environment is *dense* with intentional problems, tools, and red herrings. Agents must navigate physical collaboration, precise object identification, and role-based access—all while ignoring distracting mundanity."
