By analyzing temperatures with equipment that is accurate within a tenth of a degree, can see where leaks are, and they can see how well a wall is insulated. They can also measure ducts in HVAC systems to detect what percentage of air is being used to condition the home, and what percentage is being vented outdoors or in crawlspaces.\n\n• Company: Green Vision Energy\n\n• Location: Chattanooga\n\n• How it's green: It's all about learning the most cost-effective way to save on energy consumption, said Justin Wade, director of marketing and technology. If they can provide homeowners with Energy Star certification, the owner is eligible for a tax break. The Wade brothers use the Home Energy Rating System, a federal standard, to measure a home's energy use.\n\n• Why do it this way? Using high-tech infrared camera and pressurizing the house is the only way to get an accurate reading on a home's leaks and drafts, Wade said. A visual walk through can only see so much, while infrared can see through walls.\n\n• What's the cost?: $500 for a house up to 2,500 square feet.\n\n• Advice for others: As with any new technology, a certain amount of marketing consists of informing the public about the fact that options exist for lowering their monthly utility bills.\n\n• Is environmentalism an essential part of the business? Creating energy, be it natural gas or electricity obtained by burning coal, has an impact on the environment. By reducing the amount of wasted energy, each homeowner can reduce his impact on the environment.\n",
  "response": "# **Energy Efficiency Audit Office - Scene Concept Design**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nAn **Energy Efficiency Audit Office** serves as the headquarters for a small, eco-conscious consulting firm specializing in home energy diagnostics. The environment is inherently collaborative, requiring teams to analyze thermal imaging data, prepare equipment for field inspections, and coordinate with homeowners. The space is dense with specialized tools, diagnostic devices, and client case files, making it ideal for multi-agent tasks involving data interpretation, equipment handling, and problem-solving.  \n\n### **Why Collaboration is Essential**  \n- **Heavy/Bulky Equipment:** Some diagnostic tools (blower door fans, thermal cameras on tripods) require two agents to transport or set up.  \n- **Data Cross-Referencing:** Reports must be compared with thermal images, requiring one agent to operate a computer while another inspects physical files.  \n- **Tool & Supply Management:** Missing or misplaced items (calibration tools, spare batteries) create dependencies where agents must search different areas.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe office is a converted industrial loft with exposed brick walls and large windows, divided into three functional zones:  \n\n1. **Main Workroom** – The central hub with workstations, diagnostic equipment, and a large drafting table for reviewing blueprints.  \n2. **Equipment Storage & Prep Bay** – A garage-like area where field gear is stored, calibrated, and packed for audits.  \n3. **Client Meeting Nook** – A small lounge for homeowner consultations, featuring sample insulation materials and energy-saving product displays.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Workroom**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Large Central Workbench (2.5m x 1.2m, steel frame, scratched laminate surface)** – Used for assembling diagnostic kits and laying out thermal prints.  \n- **Dual-Monitor Workstation (27\" 4K displays, wired to a high-end PC labeled \"THERMAL ANALYSIS STATION\")** – Primary hub for reviewing infrared scans.  \n- **Wall-Mounted Whiteboard (3m wide, covered in equations, client addresses, and sticky notes)** – Tracks pending audits and energy loss patterns.  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Infrared Camera (FLIR T1030, battery 42%, lens cap missing, stored in a foam-lined Pelican case)** – Critical for fieldwork, requires calibration before use.  \n- **Blower Door Fan (120V, 75kg, folded tripod legs, duct taped power cord)** – Used to depressurize homes; requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Client Binder (\"Morrison Residence – Suspected Attic Leaks\")** – Contains handwritten notes, thermal prints, and an unplugged USB drive labeled \"DRAFT REPORT.\"  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Laser Printer (HP Color LaserJet, low toner warning blinking, stack of Energy Star brochures in output tray)**  \n- **Adjustable Desk Lamp (LED, flickering slightly, switch jammed in \"on\" position)**  \n- **Toolbox (Klein, half-open, missing 10mm socket, contains multimeter and wire strippers)**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Framed Certifications (LEED Green Associate, HERS Rater License, slightly crooked)**  \n- **Dead Pothos Plant (in a chipped \"World’s Best Energy Auditor\" mug)**  \n- **Coffee Stain (on a stack of outdated utility bills, next to a half-eaten donut)**  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Equipment Storage & Prep Bay**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Heavy-Duty Metal Shelving (4 shelves, slightly bent under weight of equipment)** – Stores field gear in labeled bins.  \n- **Workbench with Calibration Station (digital anemometer plugged in, red \"CALIBRATION IN PROGRESS\" light on)**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Manometer (digital, 0.5% accuracy, battery dead, stored in a case with a cracked latch)** – Needed for pressure differential readings.  \n- **Spare Battery Charger (overloaded with 4 Li-ion batteries, one overheating)** – Requires monitoring to prevent fire hazard.  \n- **HVAC Duct Tester (partially disassembled, missing a screw, next to a handwritten note: \"FIX BEFORE WEDNESDAY\")**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Rolling Tool Cart (wobbly left wheel, holds duct tape, zip ties, and a box of nitrile gloves)**  \n- **Extension Cord Reel (partially tangled, plugged into a GFCI outlet with a red \"HIGH LOAD\" warning sticker)**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Dusty Hard Hat (with peeling \"SAFETY FIRST\" sticker)**  \n- **Faded OSHA Poster (\"Proper Lifting Techniques\")**  \n- **Discarded Coffee Cup (labeled \"Jeremy – Do NOT throw away! – J.W.\")**  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Client Meeting Nook**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Modern Lounge Table (glass top, smudged, with a tablet embedded for digital presentations)**  \n- **Sample Display Wall (insulation types, window films, and smart thermostat demo units)**  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Energy Rebate Forms (stacked unevenly, one with coffee ring stains)**  \n- **Tablet (locked, passcode hint: \"Last 4 of office phone\")**  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Coffee Machine (Keurig, out of water, empty pod tray, \"Out of Order\" sticky note)**  \n- **Brochure Rack (half-empty, some brochures upside down)**  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Fake Plant (dusty, with a loose leaf dangling)**  \n- **Cheap Framed Art (generic \"Green Earth\" poster, slightly warped from humidity)**  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Blower Door Fan (75kg, bulky shape)** – Requires two agents to lift safely from the prep bay to a vehicle.  \n- **Thermal Camera Tripod (3m tall when extended, unstable when folded)** – Needs one agent to stabilize while another adjusts the legs.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **insulation samples** in the meeting nook, only one has a **blue fiberglass core with a \"R-30\" tag**—the rest are pink or yellow. This distinction is critical when explaining options to clients.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:** The **dead manometer** in storage requires a **charged battery** (currently overheating in the charger). An agent must first resolve the overheating issue (e.g., unplugging the charger) before retrieving a functional battery.  \n\n### **Dynamic Problem States**  \n- **Printer out of toner** → Agents must find a spare cartridge (possibly in a supply closet not yet explored).  \n- **Locked tablet in meeting nook** → Password hint requires checking the office phone’s last four digits (written on a sticky note near the workstation).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Note on Density & Realism**  \nThe scene is intentionally cluttered with **red herrings** (e.g., multiple USB drives, only one containing the correct report) and **partially solved problems** (e.g., the HVAC tester missing a screw) to force agents to carefully verify information. The **background objects** (coffee stains, outdated posters) add realism while subtly obscuring critical items—much like a real-world workspace.  \n\nThis environment is primed for **collaborative diagnostics**, **equipment troubleshooting**, and **client interaction tasks**, with enough depth to support diverse AI training scenarios."
