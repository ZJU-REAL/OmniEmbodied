  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Abandoned Video Game Testing Lab*  \n**Core Concept:** A once-cutting-edge game development lab, now abandoned but frozen in time, filled with half-finished prototypes, disconnected hardware, and remnants of a team that vanished mid-project. The environment is a maze of workstations, prototype consoles, and testing rigs, with eerie traces of interrupted work—flickering screens, scattered notes, and power fluctuations hinting at an unresolved incident.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Collaborative Debugging:** Some terminals require simultaneous inputs from multiple stations to unlock.  \n- **Heavy Equipment:** Prototype VR rigs and server racks are too bulky for one agent.  \n- **Distributed Knowledge:** Clues are scattered across workstations, forcing coordination.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Testing Chamber**  \n   - A hexagonal room with six workstations, each facing a central holographic projector (now glitching).  \n   - Flickering fluorescent lights, tangled cables, and a faint hum from inactive servers.  \n\n2. **Prototype Storage Closet**  \n   - Crowded with half-assembled consoles, labeled cartridges, and a locked cabinet marked \"P4 Prototype.\"  \n   - Smells of ozone and old plastic.  \n\n3. **Developer Bullpen**  \n   - Open-plan workspace with four desks, sticky notes covering monitors, and an overturned coffee mug staining schematics.  \n   - A whiteboard reads: \"POWER ISSUE – DO NOT USE TERMINAL 3.\"  \n\n4. **Server Room (Adjacent, Locked)**  \n   - Visible through a glass door; blinking red server lights and a loud cooling fan.  \n   - Keycard slot glows faintly.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Testing Chamber**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Central Holographic Projector (Glitching):** A circular platform with six emitter nodes, one cracked. Displays fragmented game assets (a pixelated \"Persona 4\" logo flickers).  \n- **Six Workstations:** Each has a CRT monitor (1980s-style), mechanical keyboard, and a lever-labeled \"Input Sync.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Terminal 3 (Faulty):** Screen shows \"POWER OVERRIDE ERROR.\" Back panel is loose, exposing frayed wires.  \n- **\"Expelled\" Game Cartridge:** Plugged into Station 6, labeled \"TEST BUILD - YES/NO BRANCHING.\"  \n- **Sync Levers:** Require two agents to pull simultaneously to activate the projector.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Tool Cart:** Holds a soldering iron (cold), wire cutters, and a multimeter (low battery).  \n- **Power Strip:** One socket sparks intermittently.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Poster:** \"CRITICAL BUGS = FREE PIZZA\" with a 90% eaten slice drawn on it.  \n- **Dusty Trophy:** \"Best Debugging Team 200X,\" engraved nameplate scratched off.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Prototype Storage Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy Steel Cabinet (Locked):** Requires a keycard (hidden in bullpen). Label: \"P4 – DO NOT LOAD WITHOUT BIOS UPDATE.\"  \n- **Overflow Shelving:** Bowed under the weight of dev kits.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Persona 4\" Beta Cartridge:** Blue casing, handwritten label: \"CORRUPTED SAVE FIX?\"  \n- **Server Rack (Unplugged):** Requires two agents to lift (150kg, 2m tall).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label Maker:** Out of tape, reads \"…ERRO…\" in mid-print.  \n- **Dolly (Broken):** One wheel detached.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee Stains:** Dried rings on a stack of magazines (\"Game Dev Monthly, 200X\").  \n- **Graffiti:** \"THEY DIDN’T TEST IT\" scrawled on the wall.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Developer Bullpen**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Whiteboard:** Scribbled with \"P4 BEFORE P3??\" and a flowchart ending in \"NO POWER = NO TEST.\"  \n- **Shared Desk (Cluttered):** Four monitors, one displaying a frozen command prompt: \"USER INPUT REQUIRED.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Keycard:** Taped under Desk 2, reads \"ACCESS: SERVER.\"  \n- **Frayed Power Cable:** Connects to Terminal 3 in the main chamber.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Pizza Box (Empty):** Stamped \"DEBUGGING NIGHT – 48 HRS.\"  \n- **Landline Phone:** Off-hook, static hissing.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Sticky Notes:** One reads \"darkninja – YES TO EXPEL?\"  \n- **Smashed Keyboard:** Keys \"P\" and \"4\" missing.  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Server Rack (150kg, 2m tall):** Requires two agents to maneuver around the broken dolly.  \n- **Holographic Projector Sync:** Two levers must be pulled simultaneously (stations 1 & 4).  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five cartridges, only the \"P4 Beta\" has a blue casing + handwritten label. Others are red/generic.  \n  - Distractor: A decorative blue stapler on a desk.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** Locked server room.  \n  - **Solution:** Keycard hidden under Desk 2, but the desk is wedged against a wall (needs two agents to move).  \n\n#### **Dynamic States for Task Generation:**  \n- Terminal 3 can be repaired (wire cutters + multimeter) or bypassed (alternative sync combo).  \n- The \"Expelled\" cartridge branches tasks: \"YES\" path unlocks a debug menu; \"NO\" triggers a power surge.  \n\n---  \n**Atmosphere:** The lab feels *interrupted*—a place where work stopped abruptly. Flickering lights, humming servers, and scattered personal items (a half-full coffee mug, a jacket slung over a chair) suggest a team that vanished mid-crisis. The \"P4\" prototype is the linchpin, but the environment forces agents to navigate decay, misinformation (conflicting notes), and physical barriers."
