They'll have to concentrate themselves in, say, Texas, where hordes of secession signers already live.\n    Or, maybe they could self-deport if they're so miserable. After all, Mitt Romney suggested during his campaign that we make life so miserable here for illegal aliens that \"self-deportation\" solves the nation's immigration problem.\n    Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk radio blowfly somehow sired by P.T. Barnum and Jabba the Hutt, threatened self-deportation two years ago.\n    He said if the health reform bill passed \"and it's five years from now and all that stuff gets implemented - I am leaving the country. I'll go to Costa Rica.\"\n    He's backed off from that a bit. Well, actually it seems he hasn't mentioned it for months and months. Maybe he found out Costa Rica has nationalized health care considered by some second only to Canada's in the Western Hemisphere.\n    Still, Texas is a possibility for the nation's secessionists. Some Texans already consider the place a nation-state so why not go all out? They can have Lone Star Beer and the Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo. We get the Dixie Chicks and Willie Nelson. The Chicks were boycotted years back for popping off about George W. Bush, and Nelson's cannabis consumption is the stuff of lore.\n    But one little lesson in perspective seems in order for all those anti-federal government secessionists: As Ken Burns noted in his recent PBS documentary on the 1930s Dust Bowl, a lot of people were kept from starving by the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, a federal government program. A lot those people resided in what are now the ruby red states of the nation's midsection.\n    And today, a lot of people in those red states profit handsomely from crop price supports.\n    All that, and much more, goes away in a new Confederate America. But at least they'll have Rush ... if he's not moved to Afghanistan, where a centralized government is not nearly such a problem and medicinal relief is only a poppy field away.\nReader Reaction\n",
  "response": "# **Secessionist Archive & Research Center**  \n*A high-stakes historical preservation facility where rival factions compete to control the narrative of a fractured nation*  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThis scene is set in a sprawling **\"Secessionist Archive & Research Center\"**, a high-security facility housing fragile historical documents, propaganda artifacts, and disputed evidence from past and present secessionist movements across the fictional nation of **\"New Columbia.\"**  \n\nThe facility is divided among **three rival factions**, each trying to manipulate, preserve, or destroy records to serve their political agendas:  \n- **Federal Archivists (loyalists)** – Seek to maintain federal control over historical narratives.  \n- **Free State Researchers (secessionists)** – Aim to prove the legitimacy of past breakaway states.  \n- **Neutral Conservators (independent)** – Focus solely on document preservation, resisting political interference.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Physical collaboration needed:** Heavy crates, locked vaults, and delicate artifacts require coordination.  \n- **Information asymmetry:** Different factions possess unique knowledge (e.g., one knows a safe combination, another has a key).  \n- **Conflicting objectives:** Teams must negotiate, deceive, or cooperate under time pressure.  \n\n---  \n## **2. Spatial Layout and Key Areas**  \n\n### **A. Main Document Hall (Central Hub)**  \nA grand, high-ceilinged room with rows of **steel archival shelves**, **rolling ladders**, and **glass display cases** of historical artifacts. The air smells of **old paper and ozone from flickering fluorescent lights**. A **large interactive map of New Columbia** dominates one wall, showing disputed borders in red.  \n\n### **B. Restricted Vault (High-Security Storage)**  \nA reinforced steel door leads to a **climate-controlled vault** where the most sensitive documents are kept. Inside: **locked filing cabinets**, **a biometric scanner**, and a **heavy-duty cart for transporting crates**. A **broken ventilation fan** hums loudly in the corner.  \n\n### **C. Restoration Lab (Neutral Zone)**  \nA **sterile workspace** with **document drying racks**, **UV filtering lights**, and **chemical baths** for repairing aged paper. A **fume hood** contains solvents, and a **microscanner** sits atop a vibration-dampened table.  \n\n### **D. Faction Offices (Three Separate Rooms)**  \nEach faction has a private office with:  \n- **Federal Archivists:** A **secure server rack**, **surveillance monitors**, and a **locked cabinet with master keys**.  \n- **Free State Researchers:** A **hidden floor safe**, **smuggled documents in a false-bottomed drawer**, and a **jammer for security cameras**.  \n- **Neutral Conservators:** A **coffee-stained workbench**, **handwritten restoration logs**, and a **disorganized shelf of reference books**.  \n\n### **E. Loading Dock (Entry/Exit Point)**  \nA **pallet jack**, **stacked wooden crates (some labeled \"FRAGILE – 19TH CENTURY NEWSPAPERS\")**, and a **forklift with a dead battery**. A **security checkpoint** with a **metal detector** and **ID badge scanner** controls access.  \n\n---  \n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Document Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **20 ft. steel archival shelves** (weight capacity: 500 lbs/shelf) with **rolling ladders (one missing a wheel)**.  \n- **Glass display case** (locked, key held by a Federal Archivist) containing **a tattered 1861 secession proclamation**.  \n- **Interactive map of New Columbia** (touchscreen, partially glitching, showing disputed zones).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Burned Document Fragment\"** (in a sealed plastic sleeve, requires restoration).  \n- **\"Disputed Land Deed\"** (hidden inside a hollowed-out book titled *\"Tax Records 1889\"*).  \n- **\"Broken Microfilm Reader\"** (needs a replacement bulb from the Restoration Lab).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Wheeled document cart** (one wheel squeaks, capacity: 200 lbs).  \n- **Label maker** (low on tape, last used for \"CONFIDENTIAL\" stickers).  \n- **Overhead projector** (dusty, power cord frayed).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Propaganda posters** (\"Remember the Alamo!\" / \"Unity Under the Constitution\").  \n- **Dead potted fern** (soil spilled on floor).  \n- **Coffee ring stains** on a wooden desk.  \n\n### **B. Restricted Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Biometric scanner** (requires two-factor authentication: fingerprint + keycard).  \n- **Heavy steel door** (manual lock override requires **two people to turn wheel simultaneously**).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Original Texas Secession Papers\"** (in a fireproof safe, combo known only to a Free State Researcher).  \n- **\"Surveillance Hard Drive\"** (hidden inside a dummy \"Tax Records\" box).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Document cart** (one wheel jammed).  \n- **Humidity gauge** (reading 45% RH).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Dusty framed portrait** of a 19th-century politician.  \n- **Outdated evacuation plan** taped to the wall.  \n\n---  \n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **\"Original Texas Secession Papers\" safe** (500 lbs, requires two agents to move).  \n- **Forklift battery recharge** (needs one agent to fetch a charger while another clears space).  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five nearly identical document tubes**, only **one has a faded red wax seal** (key clue for authentication).  \n  - **A \"broken\" microfilm reader** requires a replacement bulb, which is stored in a **cluttered supply closet**.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** A **locked display case** holds a critical document.  \n  - **Solution:** The key is inside a **Federal Archivist's desk drawer**, but the drawer is **secured with a combination lock** (hint found in a **coffee-stained notebook** in the Restoration Lab).  \n\n---  \n**Final Note:** This environment is designed for **emergent strategies**—agents must **negotiate, deceive, or cooperate** under **time pressure** (e.g., before a security sweep). The density of **red herrings**, **competing factions**, and **physical constraints** ensures no single agent can dominate; collaboration is mandatory."
