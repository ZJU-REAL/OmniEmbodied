Behold the future of banking?\nA new crop of ATMs in Russia (not pictured) will be outfitted with built-in lie detectors, so the machines can not only dispense cash, but assess your creditworthiness on the spot.\nKrasilnikov Stanislav/ITAR-TASS Photo/Corbis\n\nSberbank, the biggest retail bank in Russia, is testing a \"KGB-style\" ATM at branches around the country. The machine aims to prevent fraud and theft, while allowing customers to conduct complicated banking transactions with no human interaction at all. So what's the story behind this new ATM that \"the old KGB would have loved?\" Here, a brief guide:\n\nWhat exactly do these ATMs do?\nA lot more than merely dispense cash. They are equipped with built-in lie detectors, passport scanners, finger print sensors, and facial recognition software, which combined will allow consumers — including those with no previous relationship to the bank — to sign up for a credit card, or apply for a loan, right from the machine.\n\nHow does the lie-detection work?\nEach machine has a voice analysis system. When a customer uses it to apply for a loan, for example, the ATM will ask questions like, \"Are you employed?\" and \"At this moment, do you have an other outstanding loans?\" says Andrew E. Kramer at The New York Times. The machine detects nervousness and emotional distress in the customer's voice, and concludes whether he or she is telling the truth. Changes in tone and pace of speech are \"nervous reactions\" that result involuntarily when a person is \"agitated.\"\n\nWhat's the point?\nSecurity, and fraud protection. In addition to the lie detecting software, the ATMs have the ability to corroborate a customer's personal information with fingerprinting, facial recognition, and, eventually, passport scanning — making every transaction \"comically secure,\" says Graeme McMillan at TIME. Plus, in the past, too many Russians struggled with loans that they could not or would not repay, says Sberbank's Victor M. Orlovsky. The hope is that these machines can weed out future negligent debtors better than human bankers did.\n\nWhat is the KGB connection?\n\"While many things in Russia sound like offshoots of a former time when KGB ran the streets, these talking ATMs are actually from the loins of the KGB,\" says Kat Hannaford at Gizmodo. The voice-analysis system used by the machines was developed by the Speech Technology Center, which counts the KGB's intel descendants as one of its biggest clients. Given that connection, says Christina Grossman at Slate, \"it should not come as a surprise\" that the voice recordings used to design the lie-detecting software are actually people found to be lying during Soviet police interrogations. \n\nIs this legal?\nSberbank maintains that it is. \"We are not violating a client's privacy,\" says Orlovsky. \"We are just trying to find out if they are telling the truth.\"\n\nWhen are these machines coming stateside?\nWhile Deutsche Bank and Citigroup have tested \"futuristic technologies\" at branches in Berlin, Tokyo, and New York, none include lie detectors. Though American ATM are evolving, too, expect nothing more radical than advanced touchscreens. We haven't reached Minority Report levels of security, yet.\n\nSources: NY Times, TIME, Gizmodo, Slatest, New York\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Week\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"Hyper-Secure Bank Testing Facility\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-security bank testing facility where experimental financial technology is developed and evaluated. The space is designed to simulate a real bank branch but with additional layers of surveillance, biometric authentication, and AI-driven lie-detection systems embedded into ATMs.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment Movement:** Some security devices (e.g., reinforced ATM prototypes) require multiple agents to transport.  \n- **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** Complex tasks like debugging a malfunctioning lie-detector ATM or securing biometric data require coordination.  \n- **Security & Fraud Detection:** Agents must verify identities, cross-reference documents, and monitor AI outputs in real-time.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility consists of:  \n\n1. **Main Testing Floor** – Open-plan area with ATMs, biometric kiosks, and observation stations.  \n2. **Secure Development Lab** – Where engineers fine-tune lie-detection algorithms and repair hardware.  \n3. **Surveillance & Control Room** – Monitors all transactions via CCTV, voice analysis, and live biometric data.  \n4. **Client Simulation Booth** – A mock bank teller area where test subjects interact with the ATMs.  \n5. **Storage & Logistics Room** – Houses spare parts, locked biometric databases, and heavy equipment.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Testing Floor**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Modular ATM Testing Stations (x3)** – Reinforced steel frames (150kg each), bolted to the floor, equipped with biometric scanners and voice-analysis microphones.  \n- **Biometric Verification Kiosk** – A standalone pod with fingerprint, retinal, and facial recognition sensors.  \n- **Security Desk** – Large L-shaped workstation with three monitors, live-feed displays, and an emergency lockdown button.  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Prototype Lie-Detector ATM (Broken State)** – Display flickers, voice-analysis module emits an error tone. Inside: a disconnected wire bundle (labeled \"STC-VoiceMod v3.2\").  \n- **Loan Application Terminal** – Stuck in a loop, repeating: _\"Please state your employment status.\"_  \n- **Encrypted Hard Drive (Misplaced)** – Left on a chair, labeled **\"SBERBANK - INTERROGATION VOICE DATASET #47\"**.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Tool Cart** – Wrenches, screwdrivers, USB debug cables, and a multimeter (set to voltage mode).  \n- **Transaction Printer** – Jammed, with a crumpled test receipt stuck inside.  \n- **Coffee Machine** – Half-full carafe, warm but not hot.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **\"Security Protocol\" Posters** – Faded, peeling at edges, listing \"KGB-Approved Authentication Steps.\"  \n- **Dusty Trophy** – Engraved: _\"Sberbank Innovation Award 2021.\"_  \n- **Scattered Test Documents** – Fake loan applications with scribbled notes like _\"VOICE STRESS: 87% - FRAUD RISK.\"_  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Secure Development Lab**  \n\n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Server Rack** – Humming loudly, housing the lie-detection AI (STC-SpeechAnalysis v4.1).  \n- **Workbench with Microscope & Soldering Station** – Partially disassembled fingerprint scanner.  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Debug Console (Locked)** – Requires a keycard (last seen in Surveillance Room).  \n- **Voice Sample Database** – A stack of hard drives labeled **\"KGB INTERROGATION ARCHIVES - CLASSIFIED.\"**  \n- **Faulty Biometric Sensor** – Gives false positives; needs recalibration.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Oscilloscope** – Displaying erratic waveforms from the voice module.  \n- **Spare Parts Bin** – Filled with circuit boards, microphones, and fingerprint readers.  \n- **Whiteboard** – Scribbled equations: _\"Stress Threshold = 0.78 ± 0.05\"_  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Old Soviet-Era Radio** – Non-functional, covered in dust.  \n- **Coffee Stains** – Dried spills on a technical manual.  \n- **Framed Photo** – A black-and-white image of a KGB officer (caption: _\"Inspired by the Past.\"_)  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Prototype ATM (150kg, 2m tall)** – Requires two agents to lift due to reinforced casing.  \n- **Server Rack (200kg, needs wheeled cart)** – Must be moved carefully to avoid dislodging cables.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five biometric scanners, only one has a **blue calibration sticker** and a **loose wire**—this is the faulty unit needing repair.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The locked debug console in the lab.  \n  - **Solution:** The keycard is hidden under a stack of manuals in the Surveillance Room.  \n\n### **Distractors & Noise**  \n- The **Soviet-era radio** is a red herring—non-functional but visually similar to a voice module.  \n- **Multiple hard drives**—only one contains the critical KGB interrogation dataset.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes:**  \nThis environment is **dense with interactive objects, layered challenges, and realistic clutter**, making it ideal for multi-agent collaboration, tool-based problem-solving, and security protocol testing. The **lie-detection mechanics** add a unique layer of AI-human interaction, while the **KGB-inspired aesthetic** deepens the atmosphere of surveillance and secrecy.  \n\nWould you like any refinements or additional layers of detail?"
