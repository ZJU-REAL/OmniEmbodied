The objective of the new problem is constructed so that\n\n1) Any feasible solution of the new problem has objective value $\\ge 0$.\n\n2) Feasible solutions of the new problem where the objective value is $0$ have all artificial variables $0$ and correspond to feasible solutions of the original problem.\n\nWhen you solve the new problem, it may be that the objective value of the optimal solution is not $0$, in which case you declare the original problem infeasible. Otherwise, the objective value is $0$, and thus you have a feasible solution of the original.\n\nThere is one technicality: it may be that you get a feasible solution that is not basic. This would mean that one or more artificial variables is still in the basis though its value is $0$. If the row of the simplex tableau for such a basic artificial variable contains a nonzero entry for a non-artificial variable, do a pivot where that non-artificial variable enters the basis and the artificial variable leaves. Because the value for that artificial variable was $0$, this is a degenerate pivot which won't ruin feasibility. It is possible that this process will remove all artificial variables from the basis and leave you with a basis consisting of non-artificial variables, and thus a basic feasible solution.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that you may get an artificial basic variable that can't be removed by this method, since all non-artificial variables have coefficient $0$ in its row. What that means is that there was a redundancy in the constraints. You can just ignore this basic artificial variable and its row of the tableau; as long as all the other artificial variables have value $0$ this one will too.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Scene Type:** *High-Precision Logistics Optimization Warehouse*  \n\n**Core Concept:** Inspired by the abstract principles of optimization and feasibility in linear programming, this scene reimagines a bustling, high-stakes warehouse where robotic and human agents must collaboratively solve complex logistical puzzles. The warehouse is a hybrid space—part distribution center, part live optimization lab—where every object’s placement, weight, and state impacts the efficiency of the system.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?** The environment is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Heavy/Large Objects**: Some crates, machinery, and storage units require coordinated lifting or transport.  \n- **Time-Sensitive Constraints**: Certain tasks (e.g., rerouting perishable goods) require parallel actions.  \n- **Information Asymmetry**: Some agents have access to digital manifests while others rely on physical markers.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n1. **Main Sorting Hub** – A vast open space with conveyor belts, robotic arms, and temporary staging tables. The heart of the operation, where incoming shipments are processed and rerouted. Fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting sharp shadows on the scuffed epoxy floor.  \n2. **Cold Storage Vault** – A refrigerated chamber (-18°C) with sealed doors, containing temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals. Frost clings to the metal racks inside.  \n3. **Optimization Control Room** – A glass-walled mezzanine overlooking the hub, housing monitors, whiteboards covered in routing algorithms, and a central server rack.  \n4. **Tool & Maintenance Bay** – A cluttered corner with spare parts, repair tools, and a disabled forklift in mid-repair.  \n5. **Loading Dock** – A semi-outdoor space with a hydraulic ramp, awaiting the next truck. Pallets of mixed goods are staged here.  \n6. **Archive & Overflow Storage** – A dimly lit back room stacked with older inventory, some mislabeled or forgotten.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Sorting Hub**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Primary Conveyor Belt System**: A 12-meter serpentine track with 3 diverging junctions (each controlled by a manual override lever). One segment is jammed, its motor emitting a high-pitched whine.  \n- **Robotic Packing Arm (Model XT-9000)**: Bolted to a steel platform, its gripper stuck mid-cycle, holding a half-crushed cardboard box. Status LED: blinking red.  \n- **Staging Tables (x4)**: Steel-framed, height-adjustable. One is tilted at 5° due to a broken leg.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Priority Shipment Crate (1.5m x 1m x 0.8m, 120kg)**: Bright orange, labeled *\"URGENT: VACCINES – KEEP UPRIGHT.\"* Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Diverted Parcel (0.3m x 0.2m, 5kg)**: Wrongly routed here from the cold storage. Label reads *\"BioSample Z-42 – DO NOT THAW.\"* Condensation beads on its surface.  \n- **Conveyor Junction Control Panel**: Three physical levers (labeled A/B/C) and a touchscreen showing error: *\"Junction 2: Obstruction Detected.\"*  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Barcode Scanners (x3)**: One hanging from a hook, one on a charging dock (battery at 23%), one buried under loose packing peanuts.  \n- **Pallet Jack**: Functional but squeaky left wheel.  \n- **Floor Markers**: Faded yellow tape arrows directing \"TO COLD STORAGE\" and \"TO LOADING.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Safety First!\" Poster**: Peeling at the corners, depicting a cartoon forklift tipping over.  \n- **Coffee Stain Cluster**: On a desk near the control panel, surrounding a half-empty mug (*\"World’s Best Logistician\"*).  \n- **Dented Metal Clipboard**: Holding a damp, crumpled packing list from last week.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Cold Storage Vault**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Freezer Racks (x6)**: Steel shelves with integrated temperature sensors. One sensor dangles by its wires, reading *\"ERR: -99°C.\"*  \n- **Heavy Airlock Door**: Requires a keycard swipe + manual hand-crank to open. A sticky note on the crank reads *\"JAM IF TURNED TOO FAST.\"*  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Misplaced Vaccine Tray (0.5m x 0.5m, 10kg)**: Thick ice coating suggests it was left here too long. Label: *\"EXPIRED – QUARANTINE.\"*  \n- **Broken Thermostat Panel**: Display frozen at *\"-18.0°C\"* despite the actual temp rising to *-12°C* (per a handheld thermometer nearby).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Insulated Gloves (x3 pairs)**: One pair torn at the fingertips.  \n- **Emergency Override Key**: Behind a *\"Break Glass\"* panel (glass intact, dusty).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Frost-Covered Warning Sign**: *\"NO ENTRY WITHOUT PPE.\"*  \n- **Ancient Snow Boots**: One upright, one toppled over near the door.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Optimization Control Room**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Server Rack (2m tall)**: Hums loudly. One drive bay is open, exposing a flashing blue SSD.  \n- **Central Whiteboard**: Covered in equations, some erased haphazardly. A corner reads *\"PHASE 1: ARTIFICIAL VARS -> PHASE 2: FEASIBLE??\"*  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Master Keycard**: Stored in a locked drawer (combination written on a sticky note under the keyboard).  \n- **Warehouse Digital Twin Monitor**: Shows a blinking red alert: *\"Route Conflict: Pallet #4412 vs. Priority Crate.\"*  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Wireless Headset**: Left on the desk, battery dead.  \n- **Label Printer**: Out of paper, error light on.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Certificate**: *\"Certified Linear Programming Expert – 2018.\"*  \n- **Stale Donut**: On a napkin next to a half-drunk energy drink.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **120kg Vaccine Crate**: Requires two agents to lift (one to stabilize, one to guide).  \n- **Jammed Conveyor Belt Panel**: One agent must hold the emergency stop button while another clears the obstruction.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning**: Among five nearly identical barcode scanners, the *correct* one has a *scratched casing* and *last scanned \"Priority Crate.\"* Others are either dead or misconfigured.  \n- **Compound Reasoning**: To fix the freezer’s thermostat, agents must:  \n  1. Retrieve the *handheld thermometer* (in cold storage, under gloves).  \n  2. Compare readings to the *server logs* (control room).  \n  3. Rewire the sensor using *tools from the maintenance bay*.  \n\n#### **Distractor Complexity:**  \n- **Decoy Keycards**: A *non-functional spare* in the control room drawer vs. the *master keycard* hidden under the keyboard.  \n- **Ambient \"Noise\"**: The *expired vaccine tray* in cold storage is visually similar to the *urgent one* in the hub—agents must cross-check labels.  \n\n---  \n\nThis warehouse is a puzzlebox of weight, state, and urgency—where every object’s properties demand collaborative reasoning and precision. Agents must navigate both physical and informational constraints to \"optimize\" the system into feasibility."
