Bustier's are usually shorter than corsets, ending at the waist, and are often worn on the outside rather than strictly as an undergarment. They usually come with four or six removable garters.\n\nCircular Knit - Process in which modern seamless hosiery is made, which results in a tapered tube, which is then sewn closed at the toe.\n\nControl Top -Pantyhose or Tights produced with the body section composed of a heavier lycra content and weight to act as a light control garment.\n\nCotton Gusset -Cotton or cotton compound fabric sewn into the gusset or crotch of pantyhose to allow them to â€œbreatheâ€.(see Gusset)\n\nCorset- A close fitting undergarment often tightened with laces and reinforced with stays. Most corsets extend from the breasts to the hips, and are constructed to enhance the figure by cinching the waist, thereby enhancing the bust and hips. Most corsets are fitted with four or more adjustable garter straps to support the stockings of your choice.\n\nCuban Heel -A rectangular designed reinforced heel, usually with a reinforced foot and backseam .Most Cuban heel stockings are also â€œFull Fashionedâ€.\n\nDenier -Relates to the weight or fineness of the yarn, which in turn relates to the sheerness of the hosiery. The finer the yarn, the lower the denier. 30 denier is considered Opaque, 20 denier is sheer, 15 denier is ultra sheer, and 10 denier or less is the very sheerest. Sheerness varies with Lycra content. Generally the 100% nylon is the sheerest. A 15 deneir 100% nylon will be more sheer than a 10 deneir stretch stocking containg lycra.\n\n\n\nFiber Content - The composition of the yarn used in the garment. Most are 100% nylon or nylon-lycra blends for more memory and durability in the yarn.\n\n\n\n\nFishnet -A smaller net design, which is taken from the construction of a fishermanâ€™s net, usually made of nylon or nylon-lycra blends. These come in seamless or seamed styles, with various designs of lace or silicone tops on the stockings and hold-ups. Also in tights or pantyhose which are very popular with dancers and for costumes.\n\n\nFully Fashioned Stockings - These are vintage style stockings of the 40â€™s and 50â€™s, made on the original flat knit machines, where the stocking is knitted flat and sewn together in the back. These stockings are usually knitted of 15 denier 100% nylon yarn, although some of the original vintage styles came on heavier 20 or 30 denier called â€œservice weightâ€ for everyday use. Authentic Fully-Fashioned stockings always have a top welt made by doubling over the top fabric and sewing it back unto itself. A â€œfinishing holeâ€ is always left in the seam in the middle of the top welt, which allows the stocking to fit better on the thigh. The design can be either of the â€œCuban heelâ€ or â€œPointed French or Europeanâ€ style. If they are not flat knitted and sewn together with a finishing hole on the back, they are not authentic Full-Fashioned stockings but modern reproductions called Full Fashion or Full Fashioned style.\n\nFull Fashioned Style - A reproduction of Fully-Fashioned stockings made on modern circular knit machines, with a sewn on seam with â€œFrench or Cubanâ€ style heel. These modern versions do not have the doubled over top welt or finishing hole like their original counterparts, but are substantially cheaper to produce.\n\nGarters -The clips that attach to the top welt of the stockings are called garters. Generally they are attached to an adjustable elastic strap, which is in turn attached to the garment worn on the waist or body, these are called garter straps. Sometimes as in the case of girdles and panty girdles the clips are attached directly to the garment without straps, these are garter clips. Garters are commonly referred to as suspenders in England.\n\nGarter Belt or garterbelts are sometimes called suspender belts in Europe. They are garments made for the express purpose of holding up stockings. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with four to twelve adjustable straps to hold up the stockings. The garter belt and the stockings should be considered a team. Stretch stockings usually require only a four-strap garterbelt to keep it in place. Non-stretch 100% nylons on the other hand require at least six straps to keep them from sagging. The height of the wearer is also an issue. Most garter belts have straps that are too long to properly support stockings unless the wearer is 5â€™8â€ or more. We sell garterbelts with much shorter straps, and even some models with extremely short straps for those who prefer the comfort of wearing their stockings very high. Also waist size is important. We sell many garter belts in sizes 38â€ to 50,â€ and for those more straps are necessary for proper support.\n\nGarter hose -This refers to a garment where a waist band, garter straps and stocking legs are permanently attached in one piece, simulating the use of a garter belt and stockings, but in fact being a one piece garment.\n\nGarter panty - A panty usually made of stretch fabric which contains garter straps or garter clips to hold up stockings without need for a garter belt, girdle or corset.\n\nGirdle- These are stretch garments sold to control the mid-section, and hold stockings up high and tight.They come in open bottom styles and panty girdles. Open bottom or OBGâ€™s are a step above a garter belt, when the wearer wants more support or control in the midsection. Panty girdles are basically a support panty with garters, as the name suggests.\n\nGirdlette- A garment that is larger than a garter belt and smaller than a girdle.\n\n\nGusset- A triangular or diamond shaped piece inserted into a garment for structural value. Usually referred to as the piece inserted into the crotch area of pantyhose or tights.\n\nHold-Ups- Stockings that stay up without the need for garters. True hold-ups usually consist of a decorative stretch lace top, with a silicone band inside of the lace to help grip the leg.\n\nHosiery- General term meaning leg covering such as stockings, pantyhose, tights, or socks.\n\nLacetop Stockings - these are traditional stockings in that they need to be held up with garters, but they have a lace top sewn to the top for added detail.\n\nLink-ups - This is a name trademarked by Pretty Polly of England, for their new stocking system that attaches them directly to a matching panty or thong, thus eliminating the need for garters. This is similar to the one-piece hose, but much better as the stocking legs can be interchanged separately.\n\nLycra- Lycra is a term trademarked by DuPont for a man made fiber that they developed, which can be produced in a range of types and deniers. It is most commonly combined with nylon for use in the hosiery industry.\n\nNylon - A man made fiber made from petroleum. It is noted for its strength, sheerness, and bright luster. Nylon can be produced in cross sections, altering its appearance and feel.\n\nNylons - A traditional term often used to describe the high gossamer stockings if the 50â€™s and 60â€™s, when stockings were all made of 100% non-stretch ultra-sheer nylon.\n\nOpera hose - This item was very popular in the 50â€™s and 60â€™s but is not seen very often today. They are very long stockings, meant to be gartered, gut without the usual welt on the top. The garters are attached to a small band at the top of the stocking, giving a long un-interrupted look to the leg. These stockings require very short garters.\n\nOpaque -The term given to stockings or tights when made of a higher denier yarn, making them less transparent and appear more dense than the lighter deniers.\n\nPantyhose -A one piece hosiery garment consisting of two sheer legs connected to a panty and waistband. Pantyhose are usually of a 15 or 20 denier yarn and transparent, as opposed to tights, which are usually constructed of 30 denier yarn and are usually more opaque to solid in color than pantyhose.\n\nPolyamide - The European term for nylon yarn.\n\nPointed Heel - A pointed reinforcement on the back of seamed hosiery which is also known as aâ€œFrench or Europeanâ€ heel.\n\nPyramid Heel -A heel similar to a pointed heel, but which reaches the point in a series of steps like a pyramid.\n\nRHT - Or Reinforced Heel and Toe stockings as they are properly called, became popular in the 1960â€™s, right after the advent of the circular knit machines. This allowed the manufacture of seamless stockings for the first time. These stockings have a darker reinforcement on the toe and the reciprocal heel to prevent runs, and they have become a nostalgic retro item throughout the years much like the Fully-Fashioned stockings of the 40â€™s and 50â€™s.\n\nReinforced - The sections of a garment that have been strengthened by double knitting to provide additional durability.This usually resulted in a darkening of the area, which is then considered a design feature. This is exemplified in the top welt of the stocking by the reinforcements of the full fashions and the RHTâ€™s.\n\n\nSandal Foot -Also known as sandal-toe, they are called sandlefoot because they can be worn with open toe or open sandal style shoes, and give the appearance of a nude foot. They are always seamless, and usually made of a light denier yarn.\n\nSeamed- This term applies to all hosiery, no matter what style, which has a back seam on it. This can be a sewn on backseam or an actual sewn in back seam like fully-fashioned stockings and some fishnets.\n\nShadow toe - This refers to a slightly reinforced toe sometimes called a run-guard toe. It is barely seen, and gives the protection of the reinforced toe, without the noticeable darkening detail.\n\n\nSheer - Sheerness is a function of light denier and full transparency. It is usually meant to reveal the lightness and filminess of the garment.\n\nSilicone- A rubber like polymer, which maintains its elasticity over a wide range of temperatures. Used inside the lace top ofhold-up stockings to cling to the skin and keep the stocking up without garters.\n\nStockings -Although the popular use of this word has come to be anything worn on the legs (i.e. pantyhose, hold-ups or tights) we will stick with the more traditional definition. Stockings, as referred to on this web site, are the traditional style that are put on individually and attached to a garter at the top for support. These can come in plain top, satin top, or lace top, but should not be confused with hold-ups, which stay up by themselves.\n\nSuspender belt - The European term for garter belt.\n\nSuspender hose -Commonly used term in Europe for a type of hose that are similar to panty hose but have no panty. The nylon leg runs all the way to the waistband, but the panty portion has been eliminated.\n\nStretch sheer - Stretch sheer usually refers to the use 15 denier or less for use in hosiery. The material can be stretch nylon yarn, or nylon-lycra stretch yarn.\n\nTights - These are pantyhose made of a heavier denier in opaque or semi-opaque yarns. They are dyed usually in deep colors, and they are more sporty and durable than pantyhose.\n\nUltra sheer - This term refers to the very light deniers, of very light transparency and high sheen. Usually of 100% non-stretch nylon.Some lycra /nylon yarns of less than 8 denier can be ultra-sheer.\n\nVictorian- This style is articulated in its unique details, and ornate patterns, originating in the Victorian era of England in the late 18th century.\n\nWaist Cinch - A structured garment similar to a corset, but starting below the bosom.\n\nWelt - This is the top most portion of the stocking where the garter clips attach. This portion is always reinforced by double stitching, and sometimes folded over and sewn onto itself as in fully-fashioned stockings. The portion where most manufacturers leave their mark, a distinct design stitched into the welt that is unique to themselves, or that style of stocking is called an underwelt.\n\nHosiery - Here, you will find our Full Fashioned Stockings, Ultra Sheer Stockings which are 100% non stretch nylon,Seamed Stockings with provocative seams up the back, Seamless Stockings which have no seams and are usually called a sandalfoot, Reinforced Heel and Toe Stockings, or RHT as they are sometimes called,Fishnet Hosiery containing fishnet stockings, pantyhose, suspender hose, and thigh highs, Lace-Top Stockings and Hold-Up Stockings which many times have lace-top welts with silicone grippers.

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Vintage Hosiery Atelier & Textile Laboratory\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA meticulously preserved **Vintage Hosiery Atelier & Textile Laboratory**, where expert seamstresses, textile engineers, and fashion historians collaborate to restore, replicate, and innovate upon antique hosiery designs. The space is a hybrid of **a 1940s-era workshop and a modern textile lab**, blending **hand-craftsmanship with precision machinery**.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Fabric Rolls & Machinery** require multiple people to maneuver.  \n- **Specialized Roles** (seamstress, textile analyst, archivist) necessitate coordination.  \n- **Time-Sensitive Tasks** (dye mixing, pattern alignment) demand synchronized workflows.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout & Area Descriptions**  \nThe atelier is divided into **five interconnected zones**:  \n\n1. **The Restoration Workshop** – A cluttered, well-lit space with antique sewing machines, magnifying lamps, and half-finished stockings stretched on wooden forms.  \n2. **The Textile Lab** – A sterile, brightly lit area with dye vats, spectrometers, and fabric-testing rigs.  \n3. **The Archive & Sample Library** – Floor-to-ceiling shelves holding delicate vintage stockings in glass cases, plus ledgers of historical patterns.  \n4. **The Garter Assembly Station** – A long workbench strewn with clasps, elastic straps, and precision pliers.  \n5. **The Shipping & Receiving Bay** – Crates of raw silk, nylon spools, and fragile antique garments awaiting inspection.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. The Restoration Workshop**  \n**Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **1930s Singer industrial sewing machine**, cast iron, bolted to a heavy oak table (weight: 120 kg).  \n- A **lightbox drafting table**, 2m x 1m, with adjustable magnifying lamps.  \n- A **wall-mounted stretching rack** with adjustable wooden leg forms (some missing toes).  \n\n**Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **half-repaired 1950s Cuban heel stocking**, back seam frayed, laid out under a magnifier.  \n- A **handwritten restoration logbook**, open to a page with smudged ink reading: *\"Lycra blend unsuitable—must source 100% nylon.\"*  \n- A **locked antique wooden spool cabinet** (key missing) rumored to hold ultra-sheer vintage nylon.  \n\n**Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **steam iron** (on, hissing faintly) perched precariously on a folded towel.  \n- A **rotary cutter** with a chipped blade next to a stack of silk scraps.  \n- A **rolling cart** holding labeled jars of thread (some labeled *\"1947 - Do Not Use\"*).  \n\n**Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- Faded **WWII-era hosiery advertisements** peeling off the walls.  \n- A **dusty mannequin torso** wearing a partially laced corset.  \n- A **chipped porcelain teacup** filled with loose pins.  \n\n---\n\n#### **B. The Textile Lab**  \n**Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **large industrial dye vat** (capacity: 50L, currently filled with indigo liquid).  \n- A **fabric tensile tester** (digital readout flickering intermittently).  \n- A **fume hood** containing volatile solvents (warning sticker: *\"NO OPEN FLAME\"*).  \n\n**Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **denier measurement device**, its calibration slightly off (reads 12 when true value is 15).  \n- A **sealed glass vial** labeled *\"Silicone Adhesive - Experimental Batch #7\"*.  \n- A **logbook** with a sticky note: *\"Test #34: 20D nylon vs. 30D lycra blend—results inconclusive.\"*  \n\n**Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **centrifuge** (lid slightly ajar, faint humming).  \n- A **microscope** with a torn stocking sample under the lens.  \n- A **refrigerator** (humming loudly) storing temperature-sensitive dyes.  \n\n**Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **corkboard** pinned with failed fabric swatches.  \n- A **leaky sink** with a slow drip into a rusted basin.  \n- A **broken analog clock** stopped at 3:17.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The Industrial Sewing Machine (120 kg)** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **The Dye Vat (50L, unstable when moved)** – Must be steadied while another agent pours.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five antique stockings in the archive, only **one** has a **hand-stitched \"finishing hole\"** (indicating true Fully-Fashioned construction). The rest are replicas—distinguishing them requires checking **welt stitching, yarn sheen, and label fonts**.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:** The **locked spool cabinet** requires finding the **brass key** (hidden inside a hollowed-out vintage garter belt in the archive).  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis scene is **a treasure trove of collaborative tasks**:  \n- **Restoring fragile stockings** (precision + teamwork).  \n- **Calibrating lab equipment** (one agent reads manual, another adjusts).  \n- **Matching historical patterns** (cross-referencing ledgers & samples).  \nEvery object has **purpose**, every corner has **history**, and every task requires **coordination**. A perfect stage for embodied AI interplay."
