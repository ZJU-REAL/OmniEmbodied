  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Military Research Outpost – Mechanized Armor Testing & Maintenance Facility*  \n**Core Concept:** A high-security, semi-abandoned military research facility specializing in experimental mechanized combat armor (EPA/PA units). The outpost is partially operational, with signs of recent evacuation—equipment left running, scattered classified documents, and unfinished maintenance tasks on several powered exoskeletons. The environment is inherently multi-agent due to:  \n- **Heavy Machinery:** Armor units and components require coordinated manipulation (e.g., lifting a detached 300kg hydraulic limb).  \n- **Safety Protocols:** Locked zones needing simultaneous keycard swipes, radiation hazards requiring dual-agent decontamination.  \n- **Procedural Complexity:** Armor assembly/repair involves interdependent toolchains (e.g., calibrating a Trident chain gun requires one agent to stabilize the mount while another adjusts targeting servos).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Testing Hangar:** A cavernous space with reinforced concrete floors stained by hydraulic fluid. Overhead gantries hold partially disassembled EPA units. Flickering hazard lights cast long shadows.  \n2. **Armor Maintenance Bay:** Adjacent to the hangar, this area has workbenches cluttered with weapon parts and diagnostic tools. One PA suit lies prone on a repair rig, its chest plate removed.  \n3. **Control Room:** Elevated glass-walled office overlooking the hangar. Banks of dormant monitors show error messages. A map of the facility is pinned under a coffee cup.  \n4. **Storage/Supply Closet:** Crowded with crates of ammunition, spare armor plating, and coolant canisters. A dented locker holds hazmat gear.  \n5. **Decontamination Airlock:** Between the hangar and exterior, this chamber has a broken UV light panel and a puddle of greenish coolant.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Testing Hangar**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Overhead Crane System:** Rusted chain hoist (max load: 500kg), manual control panel with a \"STUCK\" error light.  \n- **Test Platform:** Steel-reinforced circle (5m diameter) with scorch marks from weapon tests. Embedded weight sensors (readout: \"ERROR 47\").  \n- **Armor Storage Racks:** Three empty EPA mounting frames (one bent out of shape), labeled \"Unit Z-9,\" \"Unit A-2,\" \"Unit X-7.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Dismounted Trident Chain Gun:** 85kg, detached from an EPA unit. Barrel jammed with spent casings. Requires a torque wrench (located in Maintenance Bay) to clear.  \n- **Active Power Armor (PA-4 \"WARDOG\"):** Still powered on, left mid-test. Right arm auto-cannon is overheated (status screen: \"COOLANT LOW\").  \n- **Ballistic Missile Crate:** Unopened, labeled \"WARNING: LIVE ROUNDS – 2-PERSON LIFT REQUIRED\" (weight: 200kg).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Diagnostic Terminal:** Cracked touchscreen displaying EPA schematics. Keyboard missing the \"Enter\" key.  \n- **Tool Cart:** Wheels squeak. Holds a functional soldering iron (cold), a half-empty bottle of lubricant, and a greasy rag.  \n- **Emergency Shutdown Button:** Behind glass, labeled \"MELTDOWN PROTOCOL – BREAK IN CASE OF CORE BREACH.\"  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Posters:** \"CLEANSE ALL RADIATION BEFORE EXIT\" with peeling edges.  \n- **Dented Coffee Thermos:** Rolled under a desk, lid cracked.  \n- **Floor Stencils:** Faint yellow arrows pointing to \"EXIT\" and \"FIRE SUPPRESSION.\"  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Armor Maintenance Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Hydraulic Repair Rig:** Holds PA-3 \"BULLDOG\" with its chest cavity exposed. Servo armature is extended (stuck mid-cycle).  \n- **Weapon Bench:** Bolted-down vise grips, strewn with gun oil and shredded cleaning patches.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Torque Wrench (XZ-90 Model):** Only tool compatible with Trident chain gun’s jammed bolt. Stored in a drawer labeled \"FOR EPA USE ONLY.\"  \n- **Coolant Reservoir:** Empty, with a handwritten note: \"REFILL FROM STORAGE – USE TYPE B ONLY.\"  \n- **Armor Core Battery:** Spare unit (25kg), partially charged (LEDs: 2/5 bars).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Parts Bins:** Sorted screws, washers, and stripped wires. One bin is tipped over.  \n- **Work Light:** Adjustable-neck LED lamp, flickering at 30% brightness.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti:** \"WARDOG WAS HERE\" carved into the bench.  \n- **Outdated Calendar:** Still on July, showing a pinup drawing of an EPA suit.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n**1. Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Ballistic Missile Crate (200kg):** Requires two agents to lift. One must also clear a path by moving a tool cart (blocking the storage room door).  \n- **PA-4’s Overheated Auto-Cannon:** Needs one agent to hold the barrel steady (preventing misalignment) while another replaces the coolant line.  \n\n**2. Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five coolant canisters in Storage, only *one* is \"TYPE B\" (distinguished by a blue stripe and a torn label). The other four are red-striped (Type A, corrosive to PA systems). A decorative blue toolbox nearby adds perceptual noise.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The hydraulic rig is stuck because its control chip fried.  \n  - **Solution:** A spare chip exists in the Control Room’s locked drawer (keycard buried under paperwork). The chip must then be installed while another agent resets the rig’s power via a wall switch (located behind a hanging hazmat suit).  \n\n**Ambient Noise as Challenge:**  \n- The broken UV light in Decon flickers erratically, masking the \"ACCESS GRANTED\" beep of a keycard scanner.  \n- A stack of irrelevant ammunition manuals obscures the correct EPA maintenance guide (which is dog-eared on page 73: \"Chain Gun Clearance Procedure\").  \n\n---  \n**Final Atmosphere Notes:**  \nThe scene hums with residual energy from idle armor units. Distant, irregular drips echo from leaking pipes. A faint ozone smell lingers, blending with gun oil. Every object feels *used*—tools are grease-stained, screens have fingerprints, and the floor is a patchwork of stains and scratches. This is a place where collaboration isn’t just helpful; it’s *mandatory* for survival."
