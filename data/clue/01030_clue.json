Currently we let the default URL be used when setting up the web applications and on deployments update the web.config files with our Custom URL. When we've tried adding in our Custom URL through the CA UI and then try to login the page never loads. The web server seems to consistently redirect, checking with Fiddler I can see the login page is consistently giving a 302 redirect to an https version, which is the way the login works when the web.config is manually edited.\n\nDoing a diff with the web.config files there are no real differences between them, so it feels like there is something else that gets changed when the login url is changed through the UI and is not updated manually. Does anyone have any experience with the way the CA UI modifies the Customer Login URL and if there are changes that happen somewhere outside the web.config when the URL is changed?\n\nWhat we edit is the following:\n\n<authentication mode=\"Forms\">\n    <forms loginUrl=\"/_layouts/app/login/loginclaims.aspx\" timeout=\"60\" domain=\"corp.com\" />\n\nThis works out well when done manually, but when I put the login URL in the CA UI it appears the same in the web.config, yet when trying to login the page never loads. I've not yet been able to determine what the difference is in how the changes are seen since the web.config's are the same.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 1 down vote accepted\n\nI've set this up a few times and haven't had issue with the custom URL through CA. Check out my blog post on it, http://davidlozzi.com/2011/07/15/sharepoint-2010-create-unique-login-page-with-forms-based-authentication/, did you do similar?\n\nshare|improve this answer\nYes, that worked for us. Part of the problem we found was anytime we made a change in the CAUI it updated the web.configs with whatever was set up. In our case, with no default URL, it made that change for us without us wanting it. So this is a good cover. –  MichaelF Aug 19 '11 at 12:18\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"The Forgotten IT Security Bunker\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA long-abandoned corporate IT security bunker, once used to manage authentication systems for a sprawling enterprise. The facility was abruptly deserted years ago during a security breach scare, leaving behind critical infrastructure, half-finished configurations, and sensitive documents. The space is a maze of server racks, outdated terminals, and forgotten login portals—some still flickering with residual power.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Objects:** Server racks, backup generators, and sealed server pods require coordinated movement.  \n- **Distributed Knowledge:** Configuration files, login credentials, and access cards are scattered, demanding information-sharing.  \n- **Security Puzzles:** Some terminals require simultaneous physical and digital actions (e.g., one agent reboots a router while another enters a recovery key).  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe bunker is divided into four key zones:  \n\n1. **Main Server Hall** – The heart of the facility, dominated by towering server racks and a central monitoring station. The air hums with residual electricity, and emergency lights flicker sporadically.  \n2. **Security Hub** – A cramped room with CCTV monitors, a locked safe (containing master keys), and a wall of outdated security manuals.  \n3. **Decommissioned Developer Lab** – A chaotic workspace with scattered workstations, half-dismantled authentication servers, and a whiteboard filled with cryptic notes.  \n4. **Supply Closet & Storage** – A cluttered room with spare parts, backup drives, and a heavy-duty server crate labeled **\"DO NOT OPEN – CORP AUTH KEYS\"**.  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main Server Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Server Rack A-7 (2m tall, 300kg, bolted to floor)** – Contains two missing server blades (slots 3 & 5 empty).  \n- **Central Monitoring Station (L-shaped desk with 3 dead monitors, one flickering)** – A sticky note reads *\"Backup configs before shutdown!\"*  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Authentication Terminal (login screen frozen at \"Enter Recovery Key\")** – Keyboard missing the **F5** key (required for reboot sequence).  \n- **UPS Battery Backup (beeping, 10% charge remaining)** – Wires frayed; needs reconnection before full shutdown.  \n- **Server Blade (Slot 3, found under desk)** – Labeled **\"AUTH-SECURE-V2\"**, covered in dust but intact.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Emergency Flashlight (low battery, flickering)** – Taped to the side of Server Rack A-7.  \n- **Toolbox (partially open)** – Contains a Phillips screwdriver, a loose Ethernet cable, and a cracked USB drive.  \n- **Overhead Intercom (static buzzing)** – Occasionally emits a garbled voice: *\"…systems compromised…\"*  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Security Protocol #7\" Poster (peeling off wall)** – Lists outdated password policies.  \n- **Coffee Mug (stained, half-full of petrified liquid)** – Sits atop a stack of **\"Server Maintenance Logs (2010)\"**.  \n- **Dusty Keyboard (missing several keys)** – Abandoned near a broken chair.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Security Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Wall-Mounted Safe (1.5m tall, biometric lock)** – Scanner light is dim; requires external power.  \n- **CCTV Monitor Bank (6 screens, 3 showing static, 2 black, 1 displaying frozen login prompt)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Master Keycard (found inside a hollowed-out manual)** – Labeled **\"ADMIN OVERRIDE\"**, needed for safe.  \n- **Router Reboot Switch (behind panel, requires screwdriver access)** – Must be held for 10 seconds to reset.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Desk Phone (off-hook, dial tone playing)** – Receiver covered in fingerprints.  \n- **Security Logbook (last entry: \"LOCKDOWN INITIATED\")** – Pen still wedged between pages.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Employee of the Month (2011)\" Plaque** – Dusty, name scratched off.  \n- **Broken Coffee Machine (leaking brown liquid)** – Smells of burnt plastic.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Decommissioned Developer Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Workbench (covered in dismantled motherboards)** – Soldering iron still plugged in (cold).  \n- **Whiteboard (scribbled with \"AUTH BYPASS PATH?\")** – Half-erased, red marker dangling.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Debug Terminal (displaying \"Connection Timeout\")** – Requires manual IP re-entry (written on sticky note under desk).  \n- **Sealed Envelope (marked \"LAST CONFIG\")** – Contains a **USB dongle** with admin credentials.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Stack of Disassembled Servers (one has blinking LED)** – Can be scavenged for parts.  \n- **Wireless Keyboard (batteries corroded)** – Useless unless repaired.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Half-Eaten Sandwich (petrified, wrapped in foil)** – Left on a chair.  \n- **\"Hack the Planet!\" Sticker (peeling off monitor)** – Retro hacker aesthetic.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Supply Closet & Storage**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy Server Crate (marked \"DO NOT OPEN – CORP AUTH KEYS\", 200kg)** – Requires two agents to lift.  \n- **Metal Shelving Unit (bent from weight)** – Holds spare hard drives (some labeled, some not).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Backup Tape (labeled \"FINAL CONFIG BACKUP\")** – Needs a working tape drive (located in Security Hub).  \n- **Crowbar (rusted, leaning against wall)** – Can pry open the server crate (but risks damage).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Spare Keycard (blank, unprogrammed)** – Useless unless activated at a terminal.  \n- **Dusty Laptop (no battery, missing HDD)** – Could be repurposed.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Box of \"Outdated Security Manuals (2008)\"** – Mostly irrelevant.  \n- **Spiderwebs (thick, covering corner)** – Adds to the abandoned feel.  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Server Crate (200kg, bulky)** – Requires two agents to lift safely, or one can drag it (but risks damage).  \n- **Server Rack (300kg, bolted down)** – Must be unbolted first (requires wrench from toolbox).  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five USB drives** (one cracked, three unlabeled, one marked \"ADMIN_CREDS\"), only the correct one has a **red sticker and a small scratch** near the port.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **biometric safe** requires power.  \n  - **Solution:** The **UPS in the Server Hall** must be rewired first (needs screwdriver, then a second agent to hold wires in place).  \n\nThis environment is **deliberately layered**—requiring agents to **search, deduce, and collaborate** to recover lost authentication systems before the last power reserves fade."
