Education ministries in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia are purging school textbooks of the praise they once heaped on former dictators. Teachers are making ad hoc changes in their classrooms too. But what to teach is contentious.\n\n\nLast year, when the Muslim Brothers were in power, Egypt altered school history curricula to downplay exaggerated achievements of former president Hosni Mubarak. They also relieved Suzanne Mubarak, his wife, of her former position as one of the “greatest female figures in the history of Egypt”. It was more controversial when school teachers affiliated with the Brotherhood opted to teach their own unofficial curriculum, exaggerating the movement's role in the 2011 uprising.\n\n\nIn July when President Muhammed Morsi was ousted, calls rose to remove him from history tomes. The education minister refused, but decided that Hassan al-Banna, the Brotherhood’s founder, should not be featured.\n\n\nThere have been disputes over lesser known figures too. In September, a photograph of an Arab spring icon in a second grade Egyptian Arabic language book sparked fierce debate. Khaled Said, who was beaten to death in 2011 after being taken into police custody, is considered a trigger for the revolution. But some police and some parents objected, claiming he was a junkie and a poor role model for children.\n\n\nPost-revolutionary Libya in 2011 took a sledgehammer to its old history curriculum, a bizarre mix of leader-worship, xenophobia and feverish Arab nationalism. Libyan children now pore over every battle in their civil war and the gory details of the death of Colonel Muammar Qaddafi, their former ruler.\n\n\nHistorians have written reams on events since the Arab revolutions. Tunisian academics are studying the rebellious tendencies of revolutionary hotspots such as Kasserine, a town locals say produced more martyrs than any other in 2011. Comparisons with the West are also popular: Tunisians regularly compare their uprising to the French revolution, says Kmar Bendana, a historian.\n\n\nBut history remains a thorny and highly politicised subject. In Libya, locals continue to battle over facts. The eastern cities of Baida and Benghazi are locked in a dispute over which of them sparked the revolution. Both Misrata militia and some Benghazi fighters claim to have shot Qaddafi in October 2011. So history is a risky business for those charged with recording it. Faraj Najem, a Libyan historian, was criticised for his recent effort to expand the definition of martyrs to include those who were killed by NATO while fighting for Qaddafi. He says his endeavour may be premature “I'm writing on shifting sands,” he sighs.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Archive of Rewritten Histories\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-security **National Archives Restoration Center**, where teams of historians, archivists, and technicians collaborate to revise, redact, and reconstruct historical records in the wake of a revolution. The facility is a labyrinth of documents, artifacts, and contested narratives—each room filled with politically sensitive materials, fragile relics, and disputed records. The environment is inherently **multi-agent** due to:  \n- **Physical constraints** (bulky archive boxes, delicate artifacts requiring careful handling).  \n- **Cognitive demands** (cross-referencing conflicting sources, verifying authenticity).  \n- **Security measures** (restricted-access areas, locked cabinets, surveillance).  \n\nThe air hums with tension—some workers are loyalists, others revolutionaries, and a few are just trying to preserve history without bias.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility consists of several interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Document Processing Hub** – A bustling central workspace with sorting tables, scanners, and stacks of incoming records.  \n2. **Restricted Archives Vault** – A climate-controlled room with locked cabinets holding sensitive original documents.  \n3. **Digitization Lab** – High-resolution scanners, OCR machines, and editing terminals where revisions are made.  \n4. **Artifact Authentication Chamber** – A forensic workspace with UV lights, chemical analysis tools, and disputed historical objects.  \n5. **Debate & Review Room** – A tense space where historians argue over contested narratives, with whiteboards filled with timelines and redactions.  \n6. **Storage & Logistics Bay** – A loading dock with crates of yet-to-be-processed materials, some marked \"CLASSIFIED\" or \"FOR DESTRUCTION.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Document Processing Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **large steel-framed sorting table (2.5m x 1.2m)**, scratched from years of document handling.  \n- **Industrial shelving units (3m tall, 1m deep)** lined with labeled archive boxes.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A disputed dossier** (marked \"Mubarak Era – REVISION PENDING\") with conflicting annotations in red and black ink.  \n- **A locked briefcase (45cm x 30cm, 8kg)** labeled \"EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES – RESTRICTED ACCESS.\"  \n- **A half-shredded manuscript** caught in a malfunctioning document destroyer (blade jammed).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **working label printer** with a low-ink warning.  \n- A **wheeled cart (120cm tall, load capacity 50kg)** stacked with unsorted folders.  \n- A **wall-mounted intercom** crackling with intermittent updates from the security desk.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A faded **\"Preserve the Truth\"** propaganda poster peeling at the edges.  \n- A **coffee-stained notebook** left open with scribbled phrases like _\"Who controls the past controls the future.\"_  \n- A **dusty antique typewriter** on a side table, used for ceremonial proclamations.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Restricted Archives Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy steel door** with a **biometric scanner** (currently blinking red—\"ACCESS DENIED\").  \n- **Floor-to-ceiling archival cabinets (2.5m tall, reinforced locking mechanism)**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"The Founding Manuscript\"** – A leather-bound book under glass, rumored to contain original revolutionary oaths (glass case requires two keys to open).  \n- **A stack of burned documents** in a metal tray, partially legible under UV light.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Dehumidifier** humming softly in the corner.  \n- **A fire suppression system control panel** (status: \"ARMED\").  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A framed photo of the previous regime’s leader**, face scratched out.  \n- **A forgotten security badge** on the floor (belonging to a recently purged archivist).  \n\n*(Continue this level of detail for all areas...)*  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The \"EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES\" briefcase (8kg, dual-locking mechanism)** – Requires two agents to carry it securely to the Debate Room while avoiding surveillance cameras.  \n- **A pallet of classified documents (total weight 150kg)** – Must be moved via forklift, requiring one agent to operate the controls while another guides the load.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among **five nearly identical archive boxes**, only one contains the original uncensored draft of a revolutionary speech. It has a **small wax seal imprint** (unlike the others) and a **misaligned barcode sticker**. The presence of **decoy boxes with similar markings** increases difficulty.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:** To access the **Restricted Archives Vault**, agents must:  \n  1. Retrieve **Key A** (hidden inside a hollowed-out book in the Processing Hub).  \n  2. Find **Key B** (held by a historian in the Debate Room, who demands proof of authorization).  \n\n#### **Dynamic State Challenges:**  \n- A **leaking pipe above the Digitization Lab** threatens to damage delicate scanners. Agents must either **redirect the water flow** (using tools from Storage) or **quickly relocate equipment**.  \n- The **jammed document shredder** could destroy evidence if not fixed—requiring a technician to **manually clear the blade** while another holds the power switch in override mode.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes on Design Philosophy**  \nThis environment is **deliberately layered** with:  \n- **Physical constraints** forcing teamwork (weight, security locks).  \n- **Cognitive challenges** (verifying authenticity, resolving contradictions).  \n- **Political tension** (conflicting loyalties among NPCs).  \n- **Environmental hazards** (water leaks, jammed machinery).  \n\nEvery object serves **multiple potential functions**, ensuring that no task has a single obvious solution—agents must **negotiate, prioritize, and adapt** in a world where history itself is a battleground."
