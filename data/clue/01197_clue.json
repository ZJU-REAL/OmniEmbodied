Using QuakeC, a programmer is able to customize Quake to great extents by adding weapons, changing game logic and physics, and programming complex scenarios. It can be used to control many aspects of the game itself, such as parts of the AI, triggers, or changes in the level. The Quake engine was the only game engine to use QuakeC. Following engines used DLL game modules for customization written in C and C++ from id Tech 4 on.\n\n\nThe QuakeC source to the original id Software Quake game logic was published in 1996 and used as the basis for modifications like capture the flag and others.[1] QuakeC source code is compiled using a tool called qcc into a bytecode kept in a file called progs.dat. The programmers of Quake modifications could then publish their progs.dat bytecode without revealing their source code. Most Quake mods were published this way.\n\nQuakeC allowed the Quake engine to dominate the direction of the first-person shooter genre. Thanks to Carmack's idea of extending video game life by adding unlimited expandability (extensibility already played a big role in Doom), an enormous Internet community of gamers and programmers alike has arisen and many modern multiplayer games are extensible in some form.[citation needed]\n\nQuakeC is known as interpreted because as Quake runs, it is continually interpreting the progs.dat file.[2]\n\n\nThe syntax of QuakeC is based on that of the C programming language, explaining its name, but it does not support the implementation of new types, structures, arrays, or any kind of referencing other than the \"entity\" type (which is always a reference). QuakeC also suffers from the fact that many built-in functions (functions prototyped in the QuakeC code but actually defined within the game engine and written in C) return strings in a temporary string buffer, which can only hold one string at any given time. In other words, a construct such as\n\nSomeFunction (ftos (num1), ftos (num2));\n\nwill fail because the second call to ftos (which converts a floating-point value to a string) overwrites the string returned by the first call before SomeFunction can do something with it. QuakeC does not contain any string handling functions or file handling functions, which were simply not needed by the original game.\n\nMost video games at the time had their game logic written in plain C/C++ and compiled into the executable, which is faster. However, this makes it harder for the community to create mods and it makes the process of porting the game to another platform (such as GNU/Linux) more costly.\n\nDespite its advantages, the concept of implementing the game logic in a separate scripting language and writing an interpreter for it was soon dropped (even by John Carmack who had implemented this concept) because of the overall inflexibility of an interpreted language,[3] the increasingly complex game logic and the fact that the game logic could be packaged into a native dynamic link library whose source code could be released to the mod community.\n\nModified compilers and language extensions[edit]\n\nAs is their custom to do with nearly everything they make, id Software released the source of qcc, their QuakeC compiler, along with the original QuakeC code in 1996. Modified versions soon sprung up, including Jonathan Roy's fastqcc and Ryan \"FrikaC\" Smith's FrikQCC. These added functionality, optimizations, and compiling speed boosts.\n\nIn 1999, when id Software released the code from Quake's engine under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the workings of the bytecode interpreter were examined and new QuakeC compilers were released, such as J.P. Grossman's qccx and a new version of FrikQCC. These compilers took advantage of newly discovered features in a backwards-compatible way so that the bytecode could still be properly interpreted by unmodified Quake engines. New features include arrays, pointers, integers, for loops and string manipulation.\n\nWith the Quake engine source code now able to be changed, further features were added to QuakeC in the form of new built-in functions. Features long yearned for by QuakeC coders finally reached realization as QuakeC now had file and string handling functions, enlarged string buffers, more math functions, and so on. However, programmers taking advantage of these changes lost backwards compatibility with the unmodified Quake engine.\n\nXonotic since version 0.7 uses the gmqcc compiler.[4]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n  1. ^ Lasse Lehtinen (1996-07-25). \"QuakeC released\".

Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Theme:** *A 1990s Game Development Studio During a Crunch Period*  \n\n**Core Concept:** Inspired by the birth of QuakeC and id Software’s fast-paced, experimental game development culture, this scene depicts a late-night office where a small team of programmers, artists, and testers are racing to finalize a critical patch for an early 3D shooter. The environment is dense with retro computing equipment, prototype hardware, and debugging tools—necessitating collaboration between engineers to diagnose issues, modify game logic, and test changes in real-time.  \n\nThe scene naturally supports multi-agent collaboration due to:  \n- **Specialized Workstations:** Different machines are set up for coding, compiling, and testing, requiring coordination to synchronize changes.  \n- **Physical Prototyping Tools:** Large, unwieldy peripherals (e.g., early VR headsets, bulky testing rigs) demand teamwork to move or adjust.  \n- **Debugging Dependencies:** One person’s code change might break another’s, forcing real-time troubleshooting.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\nThe studio is a converted warehouse space, divided into loosely defined zones:  \n\n1. **Main Coding Pit** – The heart of the operation, packed with bulky CRTs, ergonomic disasters of chairs, and tangled ethernet cables.  \n2. **QA Testing Corner** – A chaotic space with mismatched monitors, prototype controllers, and a half-dismantled arcade cabinet for latency testing.  \n3. **Server Closet** – A cramped, overheated room housing the build server and a stack of whirring SCSI drives.  \n4. **Whiteboard & Planning Zone** – Covered in frantic marker scribbles, pizza-stained design documents, and a broken coffee machine.  \n5. **Storage & Hardware Junk Pile** – A graveyard of old peripherals, spare parts, and a dismantled motion-capture rig.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Coding Pit**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **heavy, L-shaped desk** (particleboard, sagging slightly under the weight of three CRTs).  \n- A **dual-monitor NeXTstation** (running the QuakeC compiler, fan buzzing irregularly).  \n- A **precariously stacked server tower** (labeled \"BUILD MACHINE #3\", side panel missing, exposing ribbon cables).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **printed QuakeC reference manual** (dog-eared, with Post-it notes marking critical pages).  \n- A **mechanical keyboard** (stuck ‘ALT’ key, spilled soda residue around the arrow keys).  \n- A **3.5\" floppy disk** (hand-labeled \"PROGS.DAT BACKUP 10/12/96\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **swivel chair** (hydraulic leak, wobbles dangerously).  \n- A **desk fan** (oscillating unevenly, bearing squeak audible).  \n- A **stack of blank CD-Rs** (for burn-testing patches).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **\"DOOM GUY\" action figure** (perched atop a monitor, missing its shotgun).  \n- A **faded \"NO CRASHING BEFORE SHIP\" motivational poster**.  \n- A **half-empty Jolt Cola can** (condensation ring staining a notepad).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. QA Testing Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **modified arcade cabinet** (running an early Quake build, joystick slightly misaligned).  \n- A **wobbly folding table** (strewn with prototype \"3D mice\" and a **VFX1 VR headset**).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **bug log binder** (open to a page reading \"LEVEL 3 TRIGGERS FAILING - CARMACK PLS FIX\").  \n- A **glitching CRT** (display flickering at 50Hz, needs percussive maintenance).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **pile of VHS tapes** (labeled \"DEMO RECORDINGS\").  \n- A **USB-to-serial adapter** (plugged into a test rig, loose connection).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **Duke Nukem poster** (partially torn, held up by duct tape).  \n- A **leaning tower of empty pizza boxes**.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Server Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **rack-mounted Linux build server** (blinking LEDs, exhaust fan choked with dust).  \n- A **spare CRT monitor** (balanced atop an old HP LaserJet).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **printed error log** (last entry: \"qcc.exe SEGFAULT - STACK OVERFLOW?\").  \n- A **box of SCSI terminators** (one missing).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **tripped circuit breaker** (needs resetting after overloads).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **yellowed UNIX admin manual** (from 1987).  \n- A **sticky note** (\"DON’T TOUCH - JOHN’S CONFIG\").  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The VR Motion-Capture Rig** (in Storage):  \n  - *Weight*: ~80kg (requires two people to lift safely).  \n  - *Dimensions*: 2m tall, baseplate secured by loose bolts.  \n  - **Task Potential:** Must be moved to QA for testing, but one person must stabilize while another unplugs cables.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five SCSI drives** in the server closet, only *one* has:  \n    - A **red \"MASTER\" jumper setting**.  \n    - A **scratched label reading \"BUILD_OS\"**.  \n    - **Background Noise:** Three other non-critical drives are also red, but lack the jumper.  \n- **Compound Tool-Use:**  \n  - **Problem:** The NeXTstation won’t compile (error: \"qcc.exe stack overflow\").  \n  - **Solution:**  \n    - Find the **physical RAM upgrade** (in the junk pile, inside an anti-static bag).  \n    - Locate a **Torx T8 screwdriver** (in a drawer under spilled coffee stirrers).  \n    - Install the RAM (requires stabilizing the tower while another person screws it in).  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Notes:** This environment thrives on **emergent problem-solving**—whether it’s debugging code, jury-rigging hardware, or coordinating physical tasks under time pressure. The density of objects ensures agents must **filter signal from noise**, while the retro-tech constraints (floppies, SCSI, CRT quirks) enforce creative collaboration."
