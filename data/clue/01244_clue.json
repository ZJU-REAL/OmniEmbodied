However, it seems like Facebook is not allowing ( or at least not liking ) for one site to have multiple similarly looking actions.\n\nFor instance, let's assume that user can both 'buy' a car, and 'buy' an insurance in our site. Although, on surface, these two action look similar, because their context is different we want to show different content - more specifically different caption - for each action that is postsed.\n\nSimple way to implement this will be defining two actions, 'BuyCar' <---> associated with Car 'BuyInsurance' <---> associated with Insurance and let them have distinctive caption template.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, since Facebook does not allow multiple similar actions to be defined within a site, I should be defining. 'Buy' <----> associated with [Car, Insurance] where this action always have only one property defined. (either Car or Insurance) Downside of having these type of action is, due to limitation in current cation's template language (lacks conditional statement), I am not able to produce different caption effectively without knowing which property is set.\n\nHow should I be handling this issue?\n\nYour help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 0 down vote accepted\n\nI think the captions do need to be something generic that will work for all connected object types. But you could use filters to defined separate aggregations for each object type.\n\nJust add an additional parameter to all of your objects and set the value of that parameter as an aggregation filter?\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Theme:** *\"The Digital Bazaar: A Multi-Agent E-Commerce Logistics Hub\"*  \n\n**Core Concept:**  \nA bustling e-commerce logistics warehouse where AI agents must collaboratively process, categorize, and fulfill orders for diverse product types (cars, insurance policies, electronics, etc.). The challenge lies in managing **seemingly similar but contextually distinct** tasks—mirroring the \"BuyCar\" vs. \"BuyInsurance\" dilemma from the inspiration text. The warehouse is divided into specialized zones, each requiring unique workflows, tools, and coordination.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- Heavy/large objects (e.g., car parts) require team lifting.  \n- Time-sensitive deliveries demand parallel processing.  \n- Complex cataloging (e.g., differentiating insurance documents from vehicle titles) needs cross-referencing.  \n\n---  \n### **Spatial Layout and Key Areas**  \n1. **Receiving Dock** – Incoming shipments (pallets, crates, drones).  \n2. **Sorting Hub** – Conveyor belts, scanning stations, overflow racks.  \n3. **Automotive Section** – Car parts, tools, diagnostic terminals.  \n4. **Insurance Desk** – Filing cabinets, document scanners, notary stamps.  \n5. **Packing Zone** – Custom packaging materials, labeling printers.  \n6. **Dispatch Bay** – Loaded trucks, robotic forklifts, delivery drones.  \n\n---  \n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Receiving Dock**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A 10m-long steel loading ramp with hydraulic lifts (weight capacity: 2,000kg).  \n- Industrial pallet racks (3m tall, labeled \"A1–A20\"), some holding half-unloaded shipments.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Sealed Car Battery Crate** (120kg, requires 2+ agents; label: \"VOLTMAX-9000, Caution: Lithium\").  \n- **Insurance Document Tote** (lightweight but marked \"URGENT: 30-min processing deadline\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Handheld barcode scanners (3x, one with a \"low battery\" alert).  \n- A wheeled dolly (one loose wheel, squeaks when pushed).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- Faded \"Safety First\" poster (partially torn).  \n- A half-empty coffee cup on a clipboard (stained with ring marks).  \n\n---  \n#### **2. Sorting Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- A labyrinth of conveyor belts (some jammed with a crumpled \"FRAGILE\" box).  \n- Overflow shelving with mismatched bins (e.g., \"Electronics\" bin contains car manuals).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Misplaced Insurance Packet** (hidden under a stack of car brochures; unique red \"CONFIDENTIAL\" stamp).  \n- **Jammed Conveyor Belt** (requires a toolkit from Automotive Section to fix).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Label printers (one out of thermal paper).  \n- A wall-mounted clock (5 minutes fast).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- A dead potted cactus on a filing cabinet.  \n- Graffiti on a trash bin (\"Robots <3 Humans\").  \n\n---  \n#### **3. Automotive Section**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- A hydraulic car lift (currently raised, holding a detached engine block).  \n- Locked tool chest (requires keycard from Insurance Desk).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Oil-Stained Workbench** (holds the only 10mm wrench, needed to fix the conveyor).  \n- **\"Test Drive\" VR Headset** (glitching; displays insurance forms instead of road simulations).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Tire pressure gauges (one leaking air).  \n- A grease-smudged terminal playing car ads (volume stuck on max).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- A dusty \"Employee of the Month\" plaque (dated 2018).  \n- A novelty air freshener (\"New Car Smell\") dangling from a shelf.  \n\n---  \n### **Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n1. **Collaborative Transportation:**  \n   - The **Car Battery Crate (120kg)** requires 2+ agents to lift safely (dimensions: 1.2m x 0.8m).  \n   - A **pallet of insurance claim folders** is lightweight but spills if tilted—needs coordinated carrying.  \n\n2. **Reasoning & Tool Use:**  \n   - **Attribute-Based:** Among five \"blue-cap\" chemical bottles in Sorting Hub, only one is **corrosive** (unique handwritten label + half-full). Distractors include a blue coffee thermos nearby.  \n   - **Compound Problem-Solving:** To fix the jammed conveyor, agents must:  \n     1. Fetch the **10mm wrench** (hidden under oily rags in Automotive).  \n     2. Use it to remove a stuck bolt (requires precise torque).  \n     3. Return the wrench to avoid penalties (tool-tracking system logs misuse).  \n\n3. **Dynamic Distractors:**  \n   - The **glitching VR headset** displays insurance forms (misdirecting agents expecting car data).  \n   - A **\"30-min deadline\" timer** ticks for insurance orders, but car parts have no timer—prioritization is ambiguous.  \n\n---  \n**Atmosphere Notes:**  \n- **Sounds:** Conveyor hum, occasional forklift beeps, paper shredder growls.  \n- **Smells:** Ozone from printers, rubber tires, stale coffee.  \n- **Lights:** Flickering LED in Dispatch Bay casts erratic shadows.  \n\nThis scene thrives on **contextual ambiguity** (e.g., \"buy\" actions for cars vs. insurance) and **physical collaboration**, forcing agents to negotiate meaning and resources in real time."
