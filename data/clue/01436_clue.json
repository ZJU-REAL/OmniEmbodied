Whatever I try, the EditText view is either clipped (attached screenshot), or, if I set shrinkColumns to either 0 or 1, the label text disappears (and the EditText view takes up the whole width). The layout is as follows:\n\nandroid:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"\nandroid:orientation=\"vertical\" android:padding=\"10dip\">\n\n  <TableLayout android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n  android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\">\n\n    <TableRow android:orientation=\"horizontal\"\n    android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\">\n\n      <TextView android:paddingRight=\"10dip\" android:layout_column=\"1\"\n      android:text=\"Label Text\" />\n      <EditText android:text=\"Very long text that makes the text view go on clipping frenzy\"\n      android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" />\n\n\n\n\nI've tried it on a 2.2 emulator running at QVGA and HVGA, a HTC Hero on 2.1 and the Wildfire on 2.1 as well. I've also played around with the clipToPadding attribute which doesn't seem to help in my case. The same issue appears if I set the hint attribute with a long text and leave the text value empty.\n\nAs I am doing nothing particularly complex, I suspect a simple error on my side. Any ideas, hints or suggestions are highly appreciated.\n\n\nalt text\n\nshare|improve this question\nyou should first try to accept some answer, it is good for you to have answer rapidly –  Paresh Mayani Nov 15 '10 at 12:13\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 7 down vote accepted\n\nSet android:shrinkColumns=\"1\" on your TableLayout, and remove android:layout_column=\"1\" from the TextView.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you! That worked perfectly. I ended up using setColumnShrinkable(1, true) to avoid shrinking the label. –  Alpha Hydrae Nov 16 '10 at 7:39\n\nAdd android:layout_weight=\"1\", to your EditText, It took a while to resolve it..........\n\nBut don't know the reason for it.......\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "**1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n*Theme:* A cluttered, high-tech software development lab where engineers race to debug a critical UI rendering issue before a product launch. The environment is a chaotic blend of digital and physical problem-solving, with multiple workstations, testing devices, and half-finished prototypes.  \n\n*Why Multi-Agent?*  \n- **Collaborative Debugging:** Engineers must cross-reference code, device logs, and physical hardware adjustments to diagnose the clipping bug.  \n- **Shared Resources:** Limited testing devices (e.g., a single HVGA emulator rig) require coordination.  \n- **Tool Interdependence:** Some tasks (e.g., recalibrating a projector for a wall-sized UI test) demand simultaneous input from multiple agents.  \n\n---  \n\n**2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n- **Main Debugging Floor (Central Open Space)**  \n  - A hexagonal worktable dominates the room, littered with disassembled phones, tangled cables, and coffee-stained schematics. Overhead, a ceiling-mounted projector casts a flickering UI prototype onto a whiteboard wall.  \n- **Device Testing Corner**  \n  - A rack of Android devices (Hero, Wildfire, QVGA/HVGA emulators) connected to a monitoring hub. Each screen displays the same clipped `EditText` glitch.  \n- **Coding Stations (Perimeter)**  \n  - Three modular desks with dual monitors. One station has a whiteboard with \"SHRINKCOLUMNS???\" scrawled in red marker.  \n- **Storage Nook**  \n  - Crowded with labeled bins: \"Adapters (Broken)\", \"Spare Touchscreens\", \"Mystery Cables\". A precarious stack of SDK manuals leans against a mini-fridge.  \n\n---  \n\n**3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n**A. Main Debugging Floor**  \n*Anchor Furniture & Installations:*  \n- **Hexagonal Worktable** (2m diameter, scratched acrylic surface). One side has a soldering station; another holds a 150kg HVGA emulator rig bolted to the table.  \n- **Projector Arm** (Extendable, currently tilted 23°). A sticky note on it reads: \"DO NOT TOUCH - CALIBRATED FOR WALL TEST\".  \n\n*Key Interactive Objects:*  \n- **Glitching Tablet** (Left on table): Display frozen on the clipped `EditText` screenshot from the Stack Overflow post. Back panel removed, exposing a loose ribbon cable.  \n- **Debug Console** (Center): A keyboard with sticky \"ALT\" and \"TAB\" keys. Screen shows `adb logcat` output with repeated `ViewRootImpl#performTraversals()` errors.  \n\n*Functional Ambient Objects:*  \n- **Cable Spool** (Under table): 10m of HDMI cable tangled with a USB-C hub.  \n- **Annotation Tools**: A mug of whiteboard markers (two dried out), a ruler with pixel/cm conversions etched into the side.  \n\n*Background Objects:*  \n- A novelty \"Stack Overflow\" stress ball (leaking gel).  \n- A framed photo of Linus Torvalds with a Post-it: \"FIX THIS OR WE SHIP WITH THE BUG - CEO\".  \n\n---  \n\n**B. Device Testing Corner**  \n*Anchor Furniture:*  \n- **Device Rack** (1.8m tall, steel frame). Holds 12 phones/emulators, each mounted on spring-loaded clamps.  \n\n*Key Interactive Objects:*  \n- **Hero Phone (2.1)** - Screen shows the `TextView` completely vanished (shrinkColumns misapplied). Back cover warm to the touch.  \n- **Wildfire Prototype** - Bootlooping. A label on the battery reads: \"DO NOT REMOVE - CRASHES ON `setColumnShrinkable()`\".  \n\n*Functional Ambient Objects:*  \n- **USB Switchbox** (4 ports, toggle buttons labeled \"LOGCAT\", \"POWER\", \"CHARGE\", \"???\")  \n- **Thermal Camera** (Mounted on a tripod, displaying a heatmap of the rack.  \n\n*Background Objects:*  \n- A chalkboard tally of \"Days Since Last Clean Build: 12\".  \n- A dead ficus plant with a USB cable coiled around its trunk.  \n\n---  \n\n**4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n*Collaborative Transportation Affordances:*  \n- **HVGA Emulator Rig** (150kg, 1.5m tall): Requires two agents to unbolt from the table and tilt safely toward the projector for a side-by-side comparison.  \n- **Whiteboard Wall**: One agent must hold a ladder steady while another adjusts the projector angle to realign the test UI.  \n\n*Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:*  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning**: Among five nearly identical Android phones in the rack, only the Hero has:  \n  - A green \"DEBUG\" sticker  \n  - A missing volume button  \n  - `logcat` output showing `E/ViewRootImpl(1437): Requested 800px but only 400px available`  \n  *(Distractor: A green sticker on the mini-fridge reads \"DEBUG JUICE\")*  \n\n- **Compound Reasoning**:  \n  - *Problem:* The wall projection flickers due to a loose HDMI cable.  \n  - *Solution:*  \n    1. Find the **Cable Tester** (buried under SDK manuals in Storage Nook)  \n    2. Use the **Thermal Camera** to identify the overheated port on the switchbox  \n    3. Replace cable with the **Gold-Plated HDMI** (locked in a drawer labeled \"EMERGENCY ONLY\")  \n\nThis scene thrives on layered digital/physical puzzles where agents must correlate code errors with hardware states, leveraging clutter as both atmosphere and deliberate cognitive friction."
