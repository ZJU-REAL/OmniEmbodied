However, \"The source added that Hulu is actively looking for a buyer and has hired Morgan Stanley to represent them.\"\n\nAside from Yahoo, what Web giant would want Hulu? \"The acquisition approach has not been made by any of the current equity holders,\" sources tell Reuters. (For the record, that includes News Corp, Walt Disney, Comcast Corp's NBC Universal and private equity firm Providence Equity Partners.) Either way, \"Someone wants Hulu to be in play -- or at least the idea of a possible sale to be very public,\" as paidContent puts it.\n\n\"Although there has been interest in the company, it remains unclear whether its owners have any desire to sell,\" writes LAT. \"Hulu has not taken any traditional steps associated with a sale such as retaining an investment bank to field offers. However, it is currently undergoing a restructuring that would give Chief Executive Jason Kilar and his executive team greater autonomy while imposing new rules on the availability of television content.\"\n\nTags: web sites\nRecommend (1) Print RSS\n",
  "response": "# **Corporate Media Acquisition War Room**  \n\n## **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-stakes corporate environment where rival teams of agents (mergers & acquisitions specialists, legal advisors, tech analysts) collaborate under extreme pressure to evaluate a potential acquisition. The scene is a **modern, glass-walled conference room** in a high-rise office, repurposed as a temporary \"war room\" for due diligence.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Physical Collaboration:** Heavy documents, large whiteboards, fragile equipment.  \n- **Cognitive Collaboration:** Different agents specialize in legal, financial, and technical analysis.  \n- **Dynamic Problem-Solving:** Real-time updates (news alerts, emails) force rapid adaptation.  \n\n---  \n\n## **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Conference Table (Negotiation Hub)** – A **10-seat smoked glass table** with built-in power outlets, surrounded by ergonomic chairs.  \n2. **Legal Documentation Station** – A **wall of filing cabinets** and a **rolling document scanner** for due diligence.  \n3. **Tech Analysis Corner** – A **rack of servers** streaming Hulu’s real-time analytics, monitored by dual 4K displays.  \n4. **Whiteboard & Strategy Wall** – A **floor-to-ceiling whiteboard** covered in financial models, sticky notes, and acquisition scenarios.  \n5. **Coffee & Break Nook** – A **semi-functional Nespresso machine**, a mini-fridge with energy drinks, and a **stack of half-eaten takeout containers**.  \n\n---  \n\n## **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main Conference Table (Negotiation Hub)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Glass-top conference table** (3m × 1.5m, weight: 120kg – requires two agents to move).  \n- **Motorized projector screen** (currently stuck halfway down, displaying a frozen PowerPoint slide).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Confidential acquisition binder** (thick, sealed with a red \"STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL\" strap, requires two people to lift).  \n- **A locked tablet** (showing live stock tickers for Hulu’s parent companies, passcode protected).  \n- **A landline phone** (flashing red, indicating an incoming call from \"Morgan Stanley\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Wireless presenter clicker** (low battery, occasionally skips slides).  \n- **Scattered pens & highlighters** (some dry, some fresh).  \n- **A charging station** (four USB-C cables, two frayed).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed Forbes magazine cover** (\"Top 10 Media Disruptors 2023\").  \n- **A forgotten suit jacket** (draped over a chair, inside pocket: a crumpled Starbucks receipt).  \n- **A potted snake plant** (dusty, slightly wilting).  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Legal Documentation Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four-drawer steel filing cabinet** (one drawer slightly misaligned, requires force to close).  \n- **Industrial document scanner** (jam light blinking, last used for a 300-page contract).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A redacted SEC filing** (stamped \"HIGHLY SENSITIVE,\" partially obscured by a coffee stain).  \n- **A locked briefcase** (digital combination, likely containing non-disclosure agreements).  \n- **A stack of printed emails** (paper-clipped, some marked with yellow \"URGENT\" tabs).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Three-hole punch** (missing the alignment guide).  \n- **A label maker** (out of tape, last label reads \"DO NOT SHARE\").  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A framed law degree** (Harvard, 2010, slightly crooked on the wall).  \n- **A box of stale donuts** (one half-eaten, powdered sugar on the scanner).  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Tech Analysis Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Server rack enclosure** (humming loudly, status LEDs blinking erratically).  \n- **Dual 4K monitors** (one displaying Hulu’s subscriber dashboard, the other frozen on a Python error log).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **External hard drive** (labeled \"Hulu Backend Data – Q2 2024,\" encrypted).  \n- **A printed network diagram** (with a handwritten note: \"AWS migration incomplete!\").  \n- **A biometric USB dongle** (required to access proprietary analytics tools).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Mechanical keyboard** (missing the \"F5\" key).  \n- **A cooling fan** (spinning weakly, rattling slightly).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A \"Hackathon 2023\" trophy** (dusty, shoved behind the monitor).  \n- **A sticky note** (\"Change dev password!!!\").  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Whiteboard & Strategy Wall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **8ft × 4ft whiteboard** (covered in multicolored dry-erase marker, some sections smudged).  \n- **Magnetic nameplate holders** (some empty, some with \"YAHOO?\" written in red).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A printed Hulu valuation spreadsheet** (last updated 2 hours ago, with sharpie corrections).  \n- **A rolled-up blueprint** (labeled \"Hulu Infrastructure – DO NOT PHOTOCOPY\").  \n\n**c.

Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A motivational poster** (\"TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK\").  \n- **A crumpled energy bar wrapper** (stuck under the whiteboard ledge).  \n\n---  \n\n## **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The glass conference table (120kg)** – Requires two agents to reposition.  \n- **The filing cabinet (drawer misalignment)** – Needs one agent to hold it steady while another retrieves documents.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Problem:** The **locked tablet** needs a passcode.  \n  - **Solution:** The passcode is scribbled on a sticky note **under the keyboard** in the Tech Corner.  \n- **Problem:** The **document scanner is jammed.**  \n  - **Solution:** A **maintenance manual** is in the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet, but the drawer is stuck.  \n\n### **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n- Among **five identical-looking USB drives** on the desk:  \n  - Only **one** has a **tiny green sticker** and is **half-full** (contains the crucial valuation model).  \n  - The others are either empty or hold irrelevant backups.  \n\n---  \n\nThis scene is **densely layered** with objects that **require precise reasoning, teamwork, and real-time adaptation**—perfect for multi-agent collaboration under pressure."
