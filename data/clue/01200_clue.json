Thanks.\n\nSmart Shopper / Prices Paid Forums\n\n\n  • ashehasheh Posts: 32\n    It might be high... this is what I am looking at and I still think its too high... I also have a G35X with Sunroof for $398/m 36000 and 12,000 miles with $1500 down.

Audi's August lease program, which is scheduled to run through September 6th, for these 2006 A4 2.0 Sedan with quattro and 2006 Audi A4 2.0Avant are exactly the same. The only thing that would cause these two models to have different lease payments is the fact that they are priced a little differently. If you provide me with the full MSRP (with the destination charge added in) and an approximate selling price for the vehicle that you are interested in leasing, I would be happy to estimate what sort of lease payment you can expect it to have for a zero down lease with 15,000 miles per year. Post a reminder in this discussion with this information in a few days, by then I should have an idea of what Audi's new September lease program is like. Talk to you soon.\n\n    Smart Shopper / Prices Paid Forums\n  • I've got a very similar question. I'm working on a deal to get the last '05 3.2 Avant on the lot. The specs of the lease sound a bit elevated. To get a $ total payment on a three year lease, with only 10k miles/yr, I have to put down over $7K. The MSRP is over $43K, but the selling price is $40,200 (about $750 over invoice). I'm curious how everyone is getting equal payments than my potential deal when they put almost nothing down (on an A4 sedan). Is it the money factor on Avants that's driving the monthly payment up? Do you by chance know what the typical money factor is on an '05 Avant, vs. an '06 Avant? Thanks.\n  • auto\n    premium package\n    bose premium sound system\n    17\" double spoke rims\n    msrp $36,670 w/ dest charge\n\n    I have not gone into discussions yet for purchasing so unsure as to how much it should cost. However, I would like to know the maximum I should be paying. Additionally, I currently own an Audi, so I was wondering if that loyalty program was still in effect.\n\n    thanks car_man\n  • I need to lease a new car within 4 weeks and have tentatively decided on the 2006 A4 3.2 Quattro. I recently went to the dealership in Santa Monica; they were extremely helpful, but I'm afraid they might take \"advantage\" of me (I'm female in my late 40's and doing this on my own). I'm interested in a 36 month lease and low monthly payments. I do not currently own an Audi.\n    Help. Thanks. clueless in LA\n  • Hi, you just missed out on the deal that expired on the 6th. Just to give you an approximate, your payment on any lease would be, at a minimum, $100 higher per month. I'm working with someone who's trying to get me the special offer even though it expired. I'm supposed to know within the next few hours if he can make it happen. If he can, I'll be driving a new Audi.\n\n    If it happens, I can refer you to him, but there's no contact info allowed on this post, so I'm not sure how to exchange information.\n\n    Here's a tip, DO NOT work with just any salesman, ask for the Internet/Fleet salesman and have an approximate idea of the invoice price. Try to deal from invoice rather then from MSRP.\n  • Thanks. I found on the net (@ CarPrices) the invoice for this model. It was almost $1200 less than the dealer invoice price I read at the dealership. That's when I became concerned about how I was being treated by the salesperson.\n\n    How much wiggle room do you think I have re: invoice price and packages?\n\n    I'm curious, why would I ask for the Internet/Fleet salesperson?\n  • Depending on when you buy, you have plenty of wiggle room. I was being offered the car at $1500 below invoice. This isn't because they were willing to take a loss, but because of MFG rebate and incentives that the consumer doesn't know about. However, they'll be more stingy on the 2006 models, I was shopping for the 2005.5, which is the same as the 2006. I don't think they're offering any lease on the 2006 3.2's yet.\n\n    But as I said, the money factor is now .0025 from .00072, which expired on 9/6/05. So if you get one now, you'll pay a pretty penny.\n\n    Why the Internet/Fleet salesperson? Because when you ask for them, they know that you've done your homework and will try to give you a better deal. A regular salesman, on the other hand, will not even match that deal. One negotiates from MSRP down and the other from Invoice up.\n  • Thanks for the prompt response.\n\n    As my screen name implies I am clueless.\n\n    1. What is the money factor?\n    2. Where did you, as a wise, but mere, consumer find out about the MFG rebate and other incentives? Are these incentives that the MFG offers the dealer? All dealers?\n    3. It seems like I would do better shopping for a 2005.5 (it is the new body style).\n    4. A woman's mag referenced a web site thru the better business bureau that rated dealerships. Unfortunately, it was not a viable site. Are you aware of any source (preferably free) that rates the dealerships ala J.D. Powers?\n\n    thanks. thanks. thanks.\n\n    clueless in LA\n  • I'd highly recommend you use carsdirect and use their services, they can get you a great deal.\n  • thank you. Your patience (I do have a tendancy to ask too many questions) and expertise (I've contacted carsdirect) is greatly appreciated.\n  • I am about to lease an 06 A4 2.0 while the current leasing specials are still around (until 30 Nov I believe) 2 yr lease, first payment (369) plus acquisition fees due at signing. Now the vehicle I have picked out has a higher msrp then the model leasing for 369 so I'm obviously willing to have a higher payment. My question is this , can you negotiate on car pricing when your leasing and not buying? It may be an obvious answer to some but this will be my first lease and was not sure. Along with that how much over invoice should I be trying to haggle with assuming you can with a lease? here is what I'm looking at MSRP and what NADA had for invoice. the car I want with its options has an msrp of 37,335. invoice on NADA is 34,791. Now on top of the dealers pricing and this leads to another question they have a dealer mark up of 1,995 (alaskan mark up) dealer prep 250$, a pan heater 200$( cold weather this I need) and something called propack 989$(which is marked as optional) so that brings their selling price to 40,768.. Now with all this info I'm hoping someone can tell me where I need to start at when negotiating the price I will lease it for. I have no intention of getting the propack (dont even know what that is) or paying the alaska mark up or the dealer prep. Is this being realistic or will I have to pay this? If not that takes off 3,234$ of their asking price of 40,768 bringing the total to 37,534 about what the MSRP was originally. All that mark up, dealer prep, propack seems like bull crap to me, is it? Any help would be appreciated and soon please, also keep in mind this is the only Audi dealer in Alaska so if I leave with out the car I cant just go to the next town to another Audi dealer. And this is the only car I want. I am not trying to get the car for invoice or 200$ over invoice just something reasonable for both parties cause I cant see paying exactly what they are asking, is 1500 over invoice appropriate perhaps? Help please anyone with knowledge on pricing and leasing..\n  • Hi gpulls. Let me begin by saying that you definitely do not want to make a $7,000 down payment on a lease! I always advise consumers against making any sort of down payment when leasing. I do so for two main reasons. The first is if your vehicle is totaled in an accident or stolen during your lease, your insurance company pays off the bank that you were leasing it through and your down payment essentially disappears. The second main reason is that down payments on leased vehicles do nothing to reduce their lease-end purchase prices. So your lease-end purchase option price for your A4 would be exactly the same, regardless of whether you had put $7,000 down, or had made absolutely no down payment at all.\n\n    The selling price that you were quoted for this car is a little on the high side. While at first $750 over invoice seems reasonable, once one take the fact that Audi is currently providing $2,500 dealer cash on this car into account it is more like $3,250 over invoice. You need to renegotiate this car's selling price and then have the dealer that you are working with calculate your lease payment using Audi Financial Services buy rate lease money factor of .00270, or better yet find an independent bank that bank that has a better lease program and run it through that.\n\n    While it is not providing any dealer cash on the '06 version of this wagon, its lease program is much more attractive on it. Its 3 year, 10,000 miles per buy rate lease money factor and residual value for a 2006 A4 3.2 Avant are currently .00155 and 57%, respectively.\n\n    Smart Shopper / Prices Paid Forums\n  • Hi gflo1. I really can't calculate a realistic lease payment on this vehicle for you without some sort of selling price. For now I can calculate one for you using a selling price of $1,000 under MSRP, which you should be able to beat. If you were to lease a 2006 Audi A4 2.0T Avant with an MSRP of $36,670 and a selling price of $35,670 through Audi Financial Services right now for 36 months with 15,000 miles per year, its zero down, pre-tax monthly payment should be around $477. I do not believe that Audi is currently offering any owner loyalty cash on this model.\n\n    Smart Shopper / Prices Paid Forums\n\n    The two most important numbers to focus on when leasing are your vehicle's selling price and the lease money factor that is being used to calculate your monthly payment. These are the two main profit centers for dealers on leases. The selling prices of leased vehicles are negotiable, just as if you were paying cash for or financing them. You may be able to get a good idea of how much you will have to pay for the car that you are interested in by visiting the following discussion: \"Audi A4: Prices Paid & Buying Experience\". Once you have negotiated an attractive selling price, have the dealer calculate a lease payment on your car using Audi Financial Services \"buy rate\" lease money factor. If you do not insist upon the dealer using the buy rate, which is currently .00220 for a 2006 A4 3.2 Quattro sedan there is a chance that they will try to mark up this car's factor to add additional back-end profit to your deal.\n\n    Smart Shopper / Prices Paid Forums\n  • Hi quest3. The selling prices of leased vehicles absolutely can and should be negotiated, just as if you were paying cash or financing. The exact amount over dealer invoice that you are able to negotiate will vary from model to model. You may want to stop by the following discussion to get an idea of how much you should pay to lease the car that you are interested in right now: \"Audi A4: Prices Paid & Buying Experience\". The prices that you find posted in this discussion will likely be lower than the one that you eventually end up paying because you are in a market, Alaska, where there is not much competition for your business. I suspect that you already know this but just in case you don't, I have heard that it is actually cheaper for many Alaskans to purchase their vehicles in other states, such as Washington, and have them shipped home than it is to pay the large mark-ups that Alaskan dealers charge.\n\n    Smart Shopper / Prices Paid Forums\n  • Hi Car_Man,\n\n    Can you tell me the money factor and residual values on the 2006 A4 2.0T Quattro Sedan for 24 months with 15k miles per year? Also, can you tell me how much dealer cash Audi is currently providing?\n\n    Thanks for all you do!\n  • I can help you too.......\n\n    The residual value on a 24 mo 15k is 73% and a converted lease rate of 3.336%. There is no cash back on 06 models right now..... :P\n\n  • Thanks so much bigdveedubgirl!! Those are the exact numbers quoted by the dealer.....Any thoughts on getting this car at or close to invoice?\n\n    Thanks Again!\n  • It just depends on what car it is and what Market you are in. As you know Audi does not have holdback, so what what profit over invoice is it. No 2% kickback. The markup is 1200-2000 depending on equipment on a 2.0tq A4. According to TMV Sticker is market value. But if the car you are looking at is an in-stock vehicle, you can ask for about 800 over invoice, but I can not guarantee you will get that. Since you were quoted the buy rate on the lease factor, even at sticker you would be getting a great deal. Some dealers might offer you close to invoice, but they probably will mark-up the lease rate. Profit needs to be made somehow. Please let me know what kind of offers you get.\n  • I am in NJ. The car has the premium and sunroof pkgs, MSRP is 35385, invoice is 32879. I could care less about the sunroof however I can't find one without it. I was offered 1400 over invoice. Works out to be $434 mo /24 months + Tax, Motor Vehicle fees ($259), acquisition fee ($575) and a $129 doc fee. The dealer has been up front with me with regard to the buy rate and residual, which I am happy about. If we get to about 750 and over invoice and lose the doc fee we will have a deal this week. If not I move on, no regrets...Should be fun!\n\n    I really appreciate your input! I will let you know how it goes....\n  • You sound like you have a very very fair deal. What a high doc fee!! $750 over is going to be difficult, like I said, NO HOLDBACK. Since the dealer is giving you buy rate, try to get a 1000 over. Doc fees are not really negotiable. If you go to another dealer, they might give you a cheaper price, but charge you higher rate. Make it easy on yourself. Since you are leasing you are only looking at a 12 dollar difference in payment. Most Audis come with sunroof package. You are already way below TMV so if they do not budge, you are still getting a awesome deal.\n\n    GOOD LUCK!!!!\n  • In NJ too and received a quote for 2006 A4 2.0 Quattro Metallic Paint, Premium, Cold Weather, Sunroof, Headlight Washer. 24-months lease 10K miles. MSRP is $35,935 and cost $34,080.\n    $1744 Down Payment $394 per month.\n\n    Is this a good deal??\n  • What is the selling price of the Vehicle? 1744, is that total out of pocket? (Also called initial investment) Sounds good to me!!! In regards to pricing, you really can't get screwed out of thousands of dollars. There is an average markup of 1500 on an A4........\n  • selling price is $34,080 ($700 above invoice of $33,380). The 1744 is the total out of pocket and includes Tax, Title, registration and doc fees.\n  • Was it $394 included taxes? What's the name of the dealership and the city. I've got a quote from Zumback in NYC and it was around 450 a month, similarly equiped. I think this is a great deal, considering i was quoted $437 for a 2005 acura TL, that had a selling price of just $30,800 and that was for 42 months will $1200 up-front! The only MAJOR issue i have with A4 is tha it's small. It's very narrow in driver side (i test drove it twice) compared to mid-size cars and there is NO leg room in the back if i move the driver sit to a comfortable position. It's nice and tall, but not wide/long enough :( .... Yet, the price is great!\n  • rprettitore,\n\n    Just an FYI.\n\n    I was quoted $390.70/mo with $1557.06 oop which included tax for 24 mo 10k.\n    I was also quoted 429.00/mo with $1595.00 oop which included tax for 24 mo with 15k miles. What I have found through discussion with dealers in NJ and also this forum (thanks to bigdveedubgirl) is that the markup is usually around 1k with little wiggle room - so far anyway. Even without the wiggle room I think it is pretty apparent that this model \"leases\" very well right now.\n\n    Hope this helps.\n\n  • Hey Car Man...\n    I'm trying to decide between an A4 and a BMW 325i. With regard to the Audi, I configured a car on their website and the MSRP came in at $35,445. According to the Edmund's TMV, people in NJ are paying MSRP. Assuming I can get this car for MSRP or maybe $1000 below, what do you think the lease payment might be for a 15,000 Mi 3 yr lease and what is the current money factor, etc.? I'm in NJ, if that makes a difference. Also, how frequently does the money factor or other lease deal variables change? I plan to get my new car within the next 2 months. Finally, can you provide a link to a forum where I can ask similar questions re: BMW 325i?\n\n    Thank you, Sir!\n\n  • Hi nick_metro. Here is the information that you are looking for. If you were to lease a 2006 A4 2.0T Quattro Sedan through Audi Financial Services right now for 24 months with 15k miles per year, its buy rate lease money factor and residual value should be .00139 and 73%, respectively. While Audi is providing dealer cash on 2005 A4s this month, it does not have any sort of cash support on '06 models.\n\n    Smart Shopper / Prices Paid Forums\nThis discussion has been closed.\n",
  "response": "### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *High-Stakes Luxury Car Dealership Showroom & Back Office*  \n**Core Concept:** A bustling Audi dealership during a major quarterly sales push, where agents must collaborate to secure high-value leases, manage inventory, and satisfy discerning customers. The environment is inherently multi-agent due to the need for synchronized tasks: salespeople negotiating with clients, mechanics inspecting trade-ins, finance specialists crunching numbers, and inventory managers tracking limited-edition vehicles.  \n\n**Why Collaboration?**  \n- **Physical Constraints:** Heavy/bulky objects (e.g., car engines, pallets of tires) require teamwork to move.  \n- **Information Asymmetry:** Critical data (e.g., lease terms, inventory spreadsheets) is scattered across departments.  \n- **Time Pressure:** Limited-time promotions (e.g., expiring money factors) force parallel task execution.  \n\n---  \n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n**A. Showroom Floor**  \n- Sleek, glass-walled space with polished concrete floors.  \n- Three spotlighted Audi A4s (metallic black, silver, deep blue) on rotating platforms.  \n- Ambient: Muted jazz, the hum of HVAC, faint scent of leather polish.  \n\n**B. Sales Office Cluster**  \n- Four glass-walled cubicles with ergonomic chairs, 27\" monitors, and branded coffee mugs.  \n- Shared printer/fax station with a jammed paper tray.  \n\n**C. Inventory Warehouse**  \n- Concrete-floored garage with 12 parked Audis (varied trims), labeled with hanging tags.  \n- A \"HOLD\" area with two 2005.5 Avants (dusty, marked for dealer cash incentives).  \n\n**D. Finance Backoffice**  \n- Soundproofed room with a wall-mounted 55\" screen showing lease residuals.  \n- Locked filing cabinet (keycode-protected) for customer credit reports.  \n\n**E. Service Bay**  \n- Hydraulic lifts, tool chests, and a diagnostic computer flashing \"O2 SENSOR ERROR\" on a 3.2 Quattro.  \n\n---  \n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n#### **A. Showroom Floor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Rotating Car Platform (Black A4):** 2.5-ton motorized stage (stuck mid-rotation due to a \"CALIBRATION ERROR\" on its touchscreen control panel).  \n- **LED Light Array:** 20x adjustable spotlights; one flickers intermittently.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Lease Kiosk Tablet:** Displaying a corrupted PDF of the \"September Money Factor Update.\" Requires a USB dongle (last seen in Sales Office C).  \n- **Demo Key Fob:** Functional, but battery low (blinking red LED).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Brochure Rack:** 50+ pamphlets (German/English mixes; only 3 correct \"2006 A4 Quattro\" sheets remain).  \n- **Coffee Station:** Half-full carafe (lukewarm), creamer spilled on counter.  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- **Framed Awards:** \"Dealer of Excellence 2004\" (slightly crooked).  \n- **Security Camera:** Red recording light active, but feed displays \"NO SIGNAL\" in the backoffice.  \n\n---  \n#### **B. Sales Office Cluster**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- **L-Shaped Desk (Cubicle #3):** Scratched veneer, sticky note reading \"CALL RE: ALASKA MARKUP\" under one leg to stabilize it.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Invoice Folder:** Contains a handwritten note: \"2005.5 Avant - $2,500 DEALER CASH - DO NOT SHOW CLIENT.\"  \n- **Calculator:** Dead battery; replacement AAs in Service Bay parts bin.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **CRM Monitor:** Frozen on \"clueless_in_LA\" customer profile.  \n- **Signing Pen:** Out of ink; fresh box in Finance Backoffice.  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- **Fake Plant:** Dusty silk ficus.  \n- **Team Photo:** 2003 Sales Champions (one face scribbled out with Sharpie).  \n\n---  \n#### **C. Inventory Warehouse**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- **Pallet Jack:** 300kg capacity, wheels squeak (needs WD-40, stored near Service Bay).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Avant #5 (2005.5):** VIN tag partially scratched off; glovebox contains a mechanic’s scribble: \"CHECK TRANSMISSION WHINE.\"  \n- **Tire Stack:** Four 18\" winter tires (one has a nail embedded; patching kit in Service Bay).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Clipboard:** Check-in sheet with 12/15 slots filled (missing pen).  \n- **Dolly:** Weight limit 150kg; currently loaded with a 200kg engine crate (overloaded warning sticker visible).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- **Oil Stain:** Fresh, spreading near Avant #5’s parking spot.  \n- **\"SOLD\" Tags:** Three crumpled in a corner.  \n\n---  \n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n**Collaborative Transportation Example:**  \n- **Engine Crate (200kg, 1.5m x 0.8m):** Requires two agents to lift safely onto the dolly (one to stabilize, one to push). Overloading the dolly risks damaging the crate’s \"FRAGILE: BI-TURBO\" label.  \n\n**Reasoning Challenge:**  \n- **Problem:** Identify the correct key fob (for the silver A4 demo) from a drawer of 10 near-identical fobs.  \n- **Attributes:** Only one has a scratched \"S/N: XJ-889\" (matches the car’s glovebox manual). Distractor: A decorative keychain with a blue Audi logo.  \n\n**Tool-Use Chain:**  \n1. **Problem:** Showroom tablet needs a USB dongle to access lease terms.  \n2. **Solution:** Dongle is in Sales Office C, inside a locked drawer (keycode written on a Post-it under Finance’s keyboard).  \n3. **Distractor:** A non-functional USB drive labeled \"LEASE RATES\" is in the coffee station drawer.  \n\n---  \n**Atmosphere Enhancers:**  \n- A radio in Service Bay plays static-heavy sports talk.  \n- The scent of ozone from the showroom’s malfunctioning electrostatic air purifier.  \n- A wall clock in Finance is 7 minutes fast (unnoticed by staff).  \n\nThis environment is a pressure cooker of deadlines, physical constraints, and hidden information—perfect for collaborative problem-solving under realistic chaos."
