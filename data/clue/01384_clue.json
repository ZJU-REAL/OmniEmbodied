Cisco Cius--Another Tablet Bites the Dust\n\n\n\nThe tablet market seems to finally be evolving into an actual tablet market rather than a strictly iPad market with a bunch of wannabe also-rans. The current crop of tablets from Samsung, Toshiba, and Asus offer compelling features at a reasonable cost. However, the Cius is following in the footsteps of the HP TouchPad and won't be sticking around to join the fray.\n\nYou might be saying to yourself, \"Cisco had a tablet?\" If so, you're forgiven. Aside from the initial unveiling and hoopla when Cisco announced the Cius, it hasn't really been in the spotlight. That's because Cisco only offered it to enterprise customers through partner channels. You couldn't just pick one up at Best Buy.\n\nEven if you could, the $750 price tag would probably convince you to just buy an iPad, or consider any of the many Android tablet alternatives that offer more features and performance for a fraction of the cost. As a tablet, the Cius is a relatively capable--yet unremarkable--7-inch Android device.\n\nSo, if the Cius isn't even offered through consumer retail channels, and wasn't positioned to compete with the Apple iPad, why did it ultimately lose to the iPad? BYOD.\n\nA Cisco research study revealed that 95 percent of the organizations surveyed allow some form of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and that more than a third (36 percent) fully embrace the BYOD concept by providing full IT support for employee-owned devices. Basically, if nearly all companies allow users to bring their own iPad to work there's no longer a market for an over-priced enterprise-centric tablet.\n\nExplaining the decision to discontinue the Cius, Cisco's OJ Winge stated in a blog post, \"These stats underscore a major shift in the way people are working, in the office, at home and on-the-go, a shift that will continue to gain momentum.\"\n\n\nEven if BYOD weren't a factor, the cost of a Cius would be hard for IT to justify. Cisco has a solid reputation and is trusted as a provider of enterprise infrastructure, but if a business can buy a 7-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for $250, why would it spend three times that amount for a Cius?\n\nRather than competing in the tablet market, Cisco will focus on meeting the software needs of tablet users across all platforms with tools like Jabber and WebEx.\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\nHands-on with Sony's latest smartglasses\n\nIDG UK Sites\n\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Abandoned Enterprise Tech Warehouse*  \n**Core Concept:** A sprawling, partially disused storage facility where a failed enterprise tech product (the *Cisco Cius tablet*) and its associated hardware were once stored. The warehouse is in a state of transition—some areas are still organized, while others are cluttered with obsolete stock, repurposed equipment, and the remnants of a BYOD transition.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Machinery & Large Objects:** Crates, server racks, and disassembly stations require coordinated lifting and movement.  \n- **Complex Inventory & Sorting Tasks:** Agents must cross-reference manifests, identify faulty units, and sort salvageable tech from e-waste.  \n- **Security & Access Control:** Some areas are locked, requiring keycards or collaborative override procedures.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Storage Bay** – The central hub with towering metal shelves, forklifts, and pallets of half-emptied crates. Dim fluorescent lighting flickers; the air smells of dust and ozone.  \n2. **Quality Control Station** – A row of workbenches with diagnostic tools, labeled bins for \"Functional,\" \"Faulty,\" and \"Salvage,\" and a wall-mounted whiteboard tracking progress.  \n3. **IT Admin Office** – A glass-walled room with a locked server rack, an outdated Cisco-branded workstation, and a bulletin board covered in BYOD policy reminders.  \n4. **Loading Dock** – A bay door partially open, revealing a parked pallet jack and stacks of shrink-wrapped pallets awaiting shipment to recyclers.  \n5. **Breakroom (Repurposed)** – Now a makeshift repair zone with coffee-stained schematics, a microwave (display stuck at 00:00), and a \"Cius Disassembly Protocol\" poster peeling off the wall.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Storage Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Heavy-duty metal shelving units (3m tall, bolted to floor)**, each with four levels holding stacked crates.  \n- **Forklift (battery at 23%, \"Low Charge\" light blinking)**, keys dangling from the ignition.  \n- **Pallet stack (1.5m tall, partially collapsed)**, with one corner crushing a box labeled \"Cius Docking Stations.\"  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed crate (dimensions 120x80x60cm, weight ~90kg, \"Cius Batch #42-F\")** – Requires two agents to lift.  \n- **\"Faulty Inventory\" clipboard** – Lists serial numbers of defective units; last updated 6 months ago.  \n- **Dented server rack (1.8m tall, wheels locked)** – Contains 20 Cius tablets in charging cradles (12 powered on, 8 dead).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Barcode scanner (low battery, sticky trigger button)** on a charging dock.  \n- **Hand truck (left tire slightly flat)** leaning against a shelf.  \n- **Industrial fan (grime-clogged, oscillating weakly)** humming in the corner.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded \"Cisco Cius: The Future of Work\" banner**, torn at one corner.  \n- **Dusty coffee cup (chipped, \"World’s Best IT Manager\" print)** on a shelf.  \n- **Pile of shredded packing foam** spilling from a ruptured garbage bag.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Quality Control Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Long workbench (scratched steel surface)**, with built-in power strips and USB hubs.  \n- **Overhead LED lamp (one bulb flickering at 5-second intervals)**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Microscope (40x magnification, lens smudged)** for inspecting circuit boards.  \n- **\"Functional\" bin (green, 3/4 full)** – Tablets here power on but may need updates.  \n- **\"Faulty\" bin (red, contains 17 tablets)** – One has a cracked screen; others show \"Boot Error.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Multimeter (display slightly faded, leads tangled)**.  \n- **Tub of thermal paste (lid not fully sealed, 30% remaining)**.  \n- **Label maker (out of tape, \"REPLACE\" sticky note attached)**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Poster: \"10 Steps to BYOD Compliance\" (with coffee-ring stains)**.  \n- **Dead potted cactus (brown, leaning)** beside a monitor.  \n- **Scattered screws and washers** in a magnetic parts tray.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Crate (\"Cius Batch #42-F\")**: 90kg weight, 1.2m length – Impossible for one agent to lift safely; requires coordination to avoid dropping (and crushing nearby boxes).  \n- **Server Rack**: Wheels are locked; two agents needed to tilt and maneuver it around the pallet stack.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning**:  \n  - Among 20 tablets in the server rack, *only one* has a **scratched serial number label**, a **cracked corner**, and **vibrates oddly when powered on**. Agents must deduce it’s the one marked \"Do Not Ship\" in the clipboard log.  \n  - **Distractor**: A decorative blue stress ball nearby matches the tablet’s casing color, risking misidentification.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning**:  \n  - **Problem**: The IT office server rack is locked; the keycard is inside a drawer, but the drawer is jammed.  \n  - **Solution**: Agents must use the **flathead screwdriver (on the workbench)** to pry it open, then retrieve the **keycard (marked \"Admin Backup\")**.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note**: This environment is *dense* with intentional problems (physical, logical, and perceptual) designed to force agents to collaborate, communicate, and reason under noise. Every object’s state and placement has a purpose—even the \"mundane\" ones (like the flickering lamp) add pressure or misdirection."
