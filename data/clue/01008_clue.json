Paranoia, suspicion, and physical ailments tear them down one by one as they come face to face with an evil that can’t be stopped with mere firepower. The writing is on the wall, both figuratively and literally, and it portends an unpleasant demise for everyone involved.\n\nIt’s clear something bad is going on here. It’s clear the woman was in the wall for a reason. And thanks to repeatedly teased memories of one soldier it’s clear the squad was part of something bad that went down prior to their arrival at the outpost. Slowburn films are fine when both the journey and the destination are worthwhile and engaging.\n\nThe Squad barely manages the former and misses the latter completely.\n\nAt least the film looks pretty though. Director Jaime Osorio Marquez works the atmosphere and general creepiness at every opportunity, and cinematographer Alejandro Moreno fills the frame with images that keep viewers on edge. There are lots of depth of field shots featuring a close up in foreground and blurry image in background that hints at something just out of sight. Stretches of silence are matched with darkness that hangs like an ominous veil across the remaining hours of their lives.\n\nBut films don’t work on pretty pictures alone, and it’s the script that’s to blame for The Squad‘s failures. These men are isolated and increasingly frightened for their lives, but there’s not a character among them worth caring about. Too much of the action happens off screen and we’re simply told about it as if that should be enough to engage our interest.\n\nUltimately the eponymous squad is left to fend fend for themselves against the unknown and each other, but their real demise comes at the hands of an enemy they never saw coming…the filmmakers.\n\nThe Upside: Eerie atmosphere; effective imagery.\n\nThe Downside: Slow build with little to no payoff; predictable in many ways; more frustrating than entertaining.\n\nGrade: C-\n\nTwitter button\nFacebook button\nGoogle+ button\nRSS feed\n\nFantastic Fest 2014\n6 Filmmaking Tips: James Gunn\nGot a Tip?

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: Abandoned Military Research Outpost**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nAn **abandoned military research outpost**, hidden deep in a remote forest, has been hastily deserted under mysterious circumstances. The facility was conducting classified experiments, and remnants of its last activities—partially destroyed documents, sealed containment units, and cryptic warnings—suggest something went horribly wrong.  \n\nThis environment is **inherently collaborative** because:  \n- **Heavy and complex machinery** requires multiple personnel to operate.  \n- **Security protocols** (locked doors, encrypted terminals) demand coordinated actions.  \n- **Hidden compartments and false walls** conceal key evidence, forcing agents to search carefully.  \n- **Physical hazards** (collapsed structures, unstable equipment) necessitate teamwork to navigate safely.  \n\nThe scene oozes **paranoia**, with flickering lights, distant mechanical hums, and the lingering sense that something—or someone—is still present.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe outpost consists of several interconnected areas:  \n\n1. **Main Entry Hall** – A dimly lit, concrete-walled space with a **security checkpoint** (defunct metal detector, abandoned guard station). The ceiling has **partially collapsed**, blocking one hallway.  \n2. **Central Laboratory** – The heart of the facility, filled with **suspended specimen tanks, broken glass, and a large autopsy table**. A **false wall** (subtly misaligned panels) hides a **hidden detention cell**.  \n3. **Armory & Supply Room** – Locked behind a reinforced door, containing **weapon racks (mostly empty)**, ammo crates, and **sealed medical supplies**.  \n4. **Command Center** – A room with **three dead computer terminals** and a **wall-mounted tactical map** covered in red X's. A **broken radio** crackles static.  \n5. **Barracks** – A cramped sleeping area with **bunk beds, footlockers, and personal effects**. One bed is **stained with dried blood**.  \n6. **Utility Corridor** – A narrow passage with **exposed wiring, leaking pipes**, and a **locked maintenance hatch** leading to a basement.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Entry Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Security desk** (metal, with a cracked monitor and an empty holster).  \n- **Metal detector archway** (partially dismantled, wires dangling).  \n- **Heavy steel door** (leading to the lab, **jammed halfway open**).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **ID Card Scanner** (functional but requires a **Level 2 keycard** to proceed).  \n- **Fallen ceiling beam** (blocking access to the barracks, requires **two agents to lift**).  \n- **Abandoned backpack** (contains a **partially burned notebook** with cryptic symbols).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Flickering fluorescent light** (casting erratic shadows).  \n- **Dust-covered CCTV monitor** (shows static, but one feed flickers with movement).  \n- **Broken coffee machine** (leaking brown liquid onto the floor).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Peeling \"RESTRICTED ACCESS\" posters** (partially torn).  \n- **A single boot** (left near the door, mud-caked).  \n- **Graffiti on the wall**: *\"DON’T LET IT OUT\"* (scrawled in red).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Central Laboratory**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Autopsy table** (stained, with **rusted restraints**).  \n- **Specimen tanks** (shattered glass, some still hold **preserved biological samples**).  \n- **Heavy containment chamber** (bolted shut, **warning lights blinking red**).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **False wall panel** (slightly ajar, hides a **detention cell with a chained chair**).  \n- **Chemical spill** (corrosive, blocks access to a **locked file cabinet**).  \n- **Emergency shutoff switch** (requires **two agents to pull simultaneously**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Buzzing refrigeration unit** (temperature gauge reads **-20°C**).  \n- **Microscope** (slide still in place, showing **abnormal tissue**).  \n- **Broken centrifuge** (spilled liquid pooling on the floor).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Shattered beakers** (glass shards everywhere).  \n- **Whiteboard** (scribbled equations, smeared in places).  \n- **Dusty lab coat** (hanging on a hook, **nametag reads \"Dr. Voss\"**).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Fallen ceiling beam** (Main Hall) – **Weight: ~250kg, Length: 3m** – Requires two agents to lift.  \n- **Containment chamber door** (Lab) – **Reinforced steel, hydraulic-sealed** – Needs simultaneous activation of two emergency release levers (on opposite sides of the room).  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Five **chemical bottles** on the lab shelf, but only **one has a blue \"Biohazard\" label and a missing safety cap**. Among the clutter of **broken glassware and decorative blue flasks**, identifying the correct one requires careful observation.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **locked armory door** has an **electronic keypad (dead battery)**.  \n  - **Solution:** A **spare power cell** is stored in the **command center desk**, requiring agents to retrieve it before accessing weapons.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Atmosphere Notes:**  \n- **Sounds:** Distant **dripping pipes**, intermittent **electrical buzzing**, occasional **metal groaning**.  \n- **Lights:** Flickering fluorescents, **emergency exit signs (dim red glow)**.  \n- **Odors:** **Ozone from damaged wiring**, **antiseptic undertones**, faint **rotting organic scent**.  \n\nThis **densely interactive** scene primes agents for **complex coordination, problem-solving, and discovery**, all while maintaining an oppressive, eerie tension."
