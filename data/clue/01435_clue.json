The language is PHP\n\nThanks for the help!\n\nshare|improve this question\n\nclosed as not a real question by Michael Petrotta, moonwave99, Dagon, talonmies, The Shift Exchange Dec 30 '12 at 8:13\n\n\nYou can't expect people to do your homework for you here. What have you tried? –  Reza S Dec 30 '12 at 3:08\nIt is not that you have no clue, it is just that you have no will. Put some effort when asking questions to the community please. –  moonwave99 Dec 30 '12 at 3:14\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nTry this:\n\n$num = 14600;\nif($num >= 1000)\n    echo round(($num/1000),1) . 'k';\nshare|improve this answer\nWhat will be the output when $num = 1000 –  harry Dec 30 '12 at 4:51\nedited. that should take care if it. –  abhi.gupta200297 Dec 30 '12 at 4:52\n\nThis will fit your need.\n\n$num = 10234;\necho round($num/1000*100)/100.'k';\nshare|improve this answer\nI think this will give a syntax error. Some thing like this \" unexpected 'k' \" –  harry Dec 30 '12 at 4:58\nNo, it won't. (Although the code is a bit ugly...) –  Licson Dec 30 '12 at 5:03\n\nThis should work for any number.\n\n$num = 1000;\necho round($num / 1000) . \"k\";\nshare|improve this answer\nunless you think a \"k\" is 1024... –  Devin Ceartas Dec 30 '12 at 3:10\nThanks, it's perfect if you add round() through it, so it looks like that: round(($num / 1000), 1) . 'k') - Thanks alot! Didn't thought so far at 4AM (my local time). –  hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Dec 30 '12 at 3:13\n@Finn - No problem, you can accept this as the answer by pressing the checkmark –  Jeremy Dec 30 '12 at 3:14\nWho dv'd?

  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"The Data Compression Lab\"**  \n\n### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling **data compression research lab** where teams of engineers, programmers, and technicians work on optimizing large-scale number processing algorithms. The lab is a chaotic mix of **high-performance computing, analog backup systems, and manual verification workflows**, requiring seamless coordination between human operators and robotic assistants.  \n\nThe core challenge lies in **collaborative data handling**—some datasets are too large for a single agent to process, some physical storage units require synchronized movement, and debugging requires cross-referencing multiple workstations.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe lab is divided into **four interconnected zones**, each with a distinct function:  \n\n1. **Main Computation Hub** – The central workspace with high-end workstations and server racks.  \n2. **Analog Verification Station** – A backup system where engineers manually cross-check digital data against printed records.  \n3. **Storage & Transport Bay** – A loading area for bulky data cartridges and equipment.  \n4. **Break & Debug Lounge** – A cluttered space where engineers troubleshoot over coffee and whiteboards.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Computation Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **modular server rack (2m tall, 1.5m wide)** with blinking LEDs indicating processing status.  \n- Three **ergonomic workstations**, each with **dual 32-inch monitors** displaying real-time compression logs.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **\"critical data buffer\" terminal** with a **jammed tape drive** (requires two agents to manually realign the spool).  \n- A **thermal printer** spitting out verification sheets, currently **jammed halfway** due to a misaligned paper feed.  \n- A **master control terminal** with a **partially corrupted display** (flickering between a numeric readout and static).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **rolling tool cart** with precision screwdrivers, cable testers, and spare SSD units.  \n- A **coffee-stained keyboard** with **three missing keycaps** (F5, F12, and Esc).  \n- A **network switch** with **two loose Ethernet cables**, intermittently disrupting data flow.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **faded \"EFFICIENCY IS KEY\" poster** peeling off the wall.  \n- A **stack of outdated programming manuals** (PHP 5.3, Perl for Dummies) on a side table.  \n- A **dusty \"Employee of the Month\" plaque** from 2018.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Analog Verification Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **large drafting table (2m x 1m)** covered in **spreadsheets and printouts**.  \n- A **wall-mounted reference chalkboard** with **half-erased calculations**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **bound ledger** labeled \"ARCHIVE 7K-10K\" containing **handwritten conversion tables**.  \n- A **mechanical calculator** with a **stuck decimal lever** (requires lubrication).  \n- A **magnifying glass** resting on an **anomalous dataset printout** (showing an incorrect rounding error).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **label maker** with **partial ink ribbon**, producing faint labels.  \n- A **rotary phone** with a **coiled cord stretched taut** from frequent use.  \n- A **paper shredder** with a **\"JAM - CLEAR MANUALLY\"** warning light.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **coffee mug filled with dried-out pens**.  \n- A **framed photo of a team retreat** (slightly askew).  \n- A **leaning tower of empty binder clips**.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Storage & Transport Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **heavy-duty server crate (150kg, 1.8m x 1.2m)** on a **wheeled pallet**.  \n- A **metal shelving unit** stacked with **data tape cartridges**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **malfunctioning robotic dolly** with **one wheel stuck**.  \n- A **cracked backup tape** labeled **\"CRITICAL - DO NOT EJECT\"**.  \n- A **locked maintenance panel** requiring **two agents to lift simultaneously**.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **handheld barcode scanner** with a **low battery indicator**.  \n- A **stack of empty plastic bins** (some cracked, some intact).  \n- A **partially deflated air duster can**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **peeling \"FRAGILE\" sticker** on the floor.  \n- A **broken clipboard** hanging by a single nail.  \n- A **dusty motivational calendar** stuck on July 2021.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **D. Break & Debug Lounge**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **stained whiteboard** covered in **half-solved equations**.  \n- A **well-worn couch** with **one broken spring**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **laptop displaying a StackOverflow thread** about \"number formatting in PHP.\"  \n- A **notebook open to a scribbled algorithm** with **question marks in the margins**.  \n- A **half-dismantled Raspberry Pi** on the coffee table.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **microwave** with a **stuck door**.  \n- A **mini-fridge** emitting a **faint buzzing noise**.  \n- A **Keurig machine** flashing **\"DESCALE REQUIRED.\"**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **pile of takeout menus** (mostly Chinese and pizza).  \n- A **leaning tower of disposable coffee cups**.  \n- A **cracked \"Hang in There\" cat poster**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- The **150kg server crate** requires two agents to move safely.  \n- The **jammed robotic dolly** needs one agent to stabilize while another repairs the wheel.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five chemical bottles** in the storage bay, only **one has a blue cap, a handwritten \"CORROSIVE\" label, and is half-full**—but a **decorative blue glass bottle** nearby adds noise.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:** The **locked maintenance panel** requires a **keycard hidden inside the ledger at the verification station**, forcing multi-step retrieval.  \n\n---  \n\nThis environment is **dense with interactive potential**, blending digital and analog workflows, requiring **physical coordination, tool-based problem-solving, and precise attribute detection**—all while immersed in a **lived-in, cluttered atmosphere**."
