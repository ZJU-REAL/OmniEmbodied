I've been experimenting with different rules and configurations – I am currently using a wordlist and I am applying the --rules=single command. As a result of running this command, I'm getting very good results with it, however, I can't seem to understand what is happening under the hood because of the following paragraph I found on Openwall's website:\n\n\nNote that running this mode on many password files simultaneously may sometimes get more passwords cracked than it would if you ran it on the individual password files separately.\n\nI'm confused by the statement \"single crack\" mode is much faster than wordlist mode. How come single mode is is faster than a simple dictionary attack if word mangling rules are being applied?\n\nAny insight into what goes on in single mode cracking would be appreciated, since I can't seem to find much documentation other than that paragraph.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 2 down vote accepted\n\nThe paragraph from JtR online documentation that you're adding to your question actually explains it pretty well.\n\nThink of it as a dictionary mode (or WordList Mode), but one that builds the list of all words found in GECOS fields, making this dictionary rather small and uses a complete set of mangling rules JtR supports.\n\nIn contrast, the WordList Mode will have a much larger set of dictionary words to run through, but using a reduced set of mangling rules designed to finish very quickly on each dictionary entry. This limits the number of guesses on each candidate word.\n\nSo in short, Simple Mode will run a complete set of mangling rules on a short but highly relevant dictionary, where Wordlist Mode will use much longer dictionary, but reduce the mangling ruleset to complete faster.\n\nThis relevance (where the word list is compiled from), on top of bigger number of mangling runs per each candidate word, is the most likely candidate for your better results using the Single Mode.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you for your comment - makes things clearer. –  Ian Muscat Jun 7 '13 at 22:21\n\nIt's using information it already has available.\n\n\n\nFrom Linux Password Cracking\n\nFound as a result from Google Search.\n\nThe typical format for the GECOS field is a comma-delimited list with this order:\n\n\n  2. Building and room number or contact person\n\n  3. Office telephone number\n\n  4. Any other contact information (pager number, fax, etc.)\n\nIn most of the UNIX systems this information can be changed by normal users using the chfn command from the shell.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\nIf the target is more advanced in their password creation, then single crack mode will likely not get a hit. If you have a dictionary of other passwords the user has used it will prove much more fruitful.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Cybersecurity Forensics Lab**  \n\n## **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-stakes **Cybersecurity Forensics Lab**, where a team of analysts must collaboratively investigate a data breach. The lab is a mix of **digital and physical forensic workstations**, **server racks**, and **evidence storage zones**, all designed to facilitate **multi-agent collaboration**—whether for heavy equipment handling, multi-step decryption tasks, or cross-referencing clues from different workstations.  \n\nThe lab is **cluttered yet purposeful**, filled with **partially decrypted hard drives, password dictionaries, forensic tools, and scattered notes**—some relevant, some red herrings. The **embedded potential** lies in the **physical-digital interplay**: some clues require accessing terminals, others demand manual evidence handling, and some demand synchronized actions between agents.  \n\n---\n\n## **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Forensic Workstation Area** – A U-shaped desk cluster with multiple monitors, forensic laptops, and decryption rigs.  \n2. **Server & Evidence Storage Zone** – A locked rack of seized hardware, including wiped drives, routers, and external storage.  \n3. **Whiteboard & Case Coordination Corner** – A wall covered in case notes, suspect timelines, and printed hash lists.  \n4. **Tool & Supply Closet** – A cramped storage area with forensic kits, spare cables, and specialized hardware.  \n5. **Break Area (Distraction Zone)** – A small table with coffee mugs, discarded snack wrappers, and a radio playing faint static.  \n\n---\n\n## **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main Forensic Workstation Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **heavy L-shaped desk (2.5m x 1.8m, steel frame)** with **three 32\" forensic monitors** on articulated arms.  \n- A **forensic laptop (Dell Latitude 7420, BIOS-locked)** connected to a **hardware decryption rig (Paladin Knight, 20kg, blinking status LEDs)**.  \n- A **server-grade workstation (rack-mounted, 150kg, requires two agents to lift)** humming faintly.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Encrypted external HDD (Seagate 4TB, labeled \"ACME CORP - CONFIDENTIAL\", tamper-evident tape intact)**.  \n- **Printed password dictionaries (three binders: \"RockYou.txt excerpts\", \"Corporate Leaks 2023\", \"Custom Mangling Rules\")**.  \n- **A sticky note on the desk reading \"Try hashcat mode 22000 first\"**.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **USB forensic write-blocker (Tableau T8, powered on, green LED)**.  \n- **A label printer (Brother PT-E550W, out of tape)**.  \n- **A wired keyboard (Logitech K120, missing the 'E' key)**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A faded \"Password Complexity Rules\" poster peeling off the wall**.  \n- **A half-empty coffee mug (chipped, \"World's Best Hacker\" text faded)**.  \n- **A dead potted cactus on the windowsill**.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Server & Evidence Storage Zone**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A locked server rack (1.8m tall, keycard access required)** with **four seized hard drives (each in anti-static bags, barcoded)**.  \n- **A forensic duplicator (Wiebetech CRU ToughTech, 25kg, needs two agents to move)**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A safe (30cm x 30cm, biometric + PIN, slightly ajar)** containing **a master keycard (marked \"Admin Override\")**.  \n- **A sticky note on the rack: \"Check drive #3 - partial match on hashes?\"**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A stack of blank evidence tags (half-used pad)**.  \n- **A label gun (Dymo 450, jammed)**.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Dusty \"Evidence Handling Protocol\" binder on a shelf**.  \n- **A broken digital clock (stuck at 3:47 AM)**.  \n\n---\n\n## **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Server Workstation (150kg, 3m long)** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Forensic Duplicator (25kg, bulky shape)** – Needs coordination to avoid damaging evidence.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning**: Among five **chemical bottles in the supply closet**, only one has a **blue cap, \"CORROSIVE\" label, and is half-full**. The others are red-capped or empty, but a **decorative blue glass paperweight** nearby adds perceptual noise.  \n- **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning**:  \n  - **Problem**: A **locked safe** in the evidence zone.  \n  - **Solution**: The **master keycard** is hidden inside the **BIOS-locked forensic laptop**, which requires first finding the **sticky note hint (\"Try hashcat mode 22000\")** to bypass.  \n\nThis scene is **designed for layered collaboration**—agents must **decrypt, lift, search, and cross-reference** while filtering out **ambient noise** (like irrelevant sticky notes or dead plants). Every object has **purposeful properties**, ensuring that tasks demand **precision and teamwork**.  \n\n---  \n**Final Note**: The lab is **alive with potential breaches, half-solved clues, and collaborative bottlenecks**—perfect for AI agents to navigate complexity."
