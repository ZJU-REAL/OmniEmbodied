Approximately a dozen manuscripts in the script were recovered from Gunjala, a Gond village in Adilabad district of Telangana by a team of researchers from the University of Hyderabad, led by Professor Jayadheer Tirumala Rao.[1] The script and preliminary font were unveiled in early 2014.[2]\n\nHistory of Manuscripts[edit]\n\nThe manuscripts have been dated to approximately 1750, based on knowledge from Gondi pundits and researchers at the Center of Dalit and Adivasi Studies and Translation (CDAST).[3] The information contained in the manuscripts includes that of the names of the months and days, a horoscope chart, grammar, and numbers. Additionally, manuscripts were found on \"knowledge of the seasons, history, and the Gondi code of ethics and literature.\" Of the historical information that has been discovered, the following cases have been reported: the 6th-7th century trade relationship between the Pardhan community and civilizations in Myanmar; the origins of the Indravelli mandal; the early eighteenth century rebellions of the Chandrapur Gond kings against the British, with the support of the Rohilla community, all of this among other pieces of information.\n\n\nThe characters themselves, while bearing resemblance to similar phonemes found in other Indian scripts, are in a different, \"native\" order, as the script starts with the letter \"ya\" instead of the traditional \"ka\" for other Indian scripts. The script includes 12 vowels and 25 consonants.[4]\n\nResponse to Discovery, Education, and Spread[edit]\n\nThe script has seen a very welcoming response by the various government agencies in Andhra Pradesh, at the national level, and local agencies in the region.[5] The existence of the manuscripts has allegedly been known for 5–9 years, but were not prioritized until 2013, when Prof. Jayadheer Tirumala Rao discovered that only four elders in the village were still able to read the script. Currently, approximately eighty students are able to read the script, with students devising stories and elder Kotnak Jangu writing an autobiography. Plans are in place for the expansion of the script to fifteen other government schools in villages with a high Gond population. A reader for the script in Telugu was released for Standard I students.[6] Efforts are being undertaken to standardize the font for the language.\n\nSee also[edit]\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Gondi Script Research & Preservation Lab*  \nA bustling interdisciplinary research lab dedicated to deciphering, preserving, and revitalizing the newly discovered Gunjala Gondi script. The space serves as a convergence point for linguists, historians, digitization specialists, and Gond community elders, fostering collaboration between modern academia and indigenous knowledge.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Complex Object Handling:** Heavy, fragile manuscripts require coordinated transport.  \n- **Specialized Expertise:** Different agents (linguists, archivists, elders) must pool knowledge.  \n- **Tool Dependencies:** Deciphering relies on cross-referencing physical manuscripts, digital tools, and oral accounts.  \n- **Time-Sensitive Work:** Some elders are among the last fluent readers—collaboration accelerates documentation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Manuscript Vault**  \n   - A climate-controlled archive with reinforced glass cases. Dim amber lighting protects fragile inks.  \n2. **Digitization Station**  \n   - High-resolution scanners, spectral cameras, and a humming server rack. Cables snake underfoot.  \n3. **Linguistics Workbench**  \n   - Crowded with reference books, magnifiers, and sticky-note-covered whiteboards mapping script phonemes.  \n4. **Elder Consultation Area**  \n   - Low seating with cushions, a ceremonial brass water vessel, and a microphone for recording oral histories.  \n5. **Supply Closet**  \n   - Overstuffed with archival boxes, gloved hands protrude from a half-shut drawer.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Manuscript Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Steel-reinforced display tables** (2m x 1m, 120kg each; require 2+ agents to move).  \n- **Humidity-controlled glass case** (1.5m tall, internal hygrometer reads 45%).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Indravelli Manuscript\"**: 18th-century palm-leaf bundle, tied with fraying hemp. One leaf is partially melted (wax spill?).  \n- **Locked metal folio case** (50cm x 70cm; biometric scanner glows red—\"Authorized Personnel Only\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **UV-filtering lamp** (on, faint blue glow).  \n- **Cart with foam padding** (wheels squeak; holds empty acid-free folders).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed 2014 news clipping**: \"Gondi Script Resurrected!\" Glass has a thumbprint smudge.  \n- **Dead fern** in corner (brown fronds crumble when touched).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Digitization Station**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Flatbed scanner** (80cm x 60cm bed; error light blinks—\"Calibration Required\").  \n- **Server rack** (1.8m tall, vents emit a low buzz; side panel slightly ajar).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Spectral camera** (lens cap missing, SD card slot empty).  \n- **Manuscript #7B** on scanner: Open to a page with a marginal doodle of a Rohilla warrior.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **External hard drives** (3 stacked; one labeled \"BACKUP?\" in shaky handwriting).  \n- **Coffee mug** (cold, dregs evaporated into a sticky residue).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Poster of Devanagari alphabet** (torn at the corner).  \n- **Dusty keyboard** (spacebar squeaks).  \n\n---  \n\n*(Continues for remaining areas...)*  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Manuscript display tables** (120kg, steel edges)—require synchronized lifting to avoid damaging floor sensors.  \n- **Server rack** (unstable when moved; one agent must steady while another unplugs cables).  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among five **inkwells** (all labeled \"pH Neutral\"), only one has a **cracked lid** (hidden under a stack of scrap paper). This is the source of a damaging leak.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** Scanner calibration error.  \n  - **Solution:** Reference manual is in the **supply closet** (page 43), but the closet is **jammed** (a warped box blocks the track).  \n\n**Background \"Noise\" as Challenge:**  \n- The **dead fern’s debris** resembles shredded manuscript fragments—agents must discern irrelevant clutter from critical evidence.  \n- **Three near-identical hard drives** force careful label-checking under time pressure (elder availability is limited).  \n\n---  \n**Final Note:** Every object serves dual purposes—functional utility *and* atmospheric pressure. The lab’s fragility (cultural and physical) demands meticulous, collaborative problem-solving."
