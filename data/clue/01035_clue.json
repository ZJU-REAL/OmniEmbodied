But the potential beneficiaries of the Dream Act are getting no love from the GOP.\n\nThat's because they are illegal immigrants -- born abroad and brought here as children by parents desperate for a better life. Why they evoke scorn is a mystery. The parents may be faulted for overlooking our laws, but not their offspring, who had no say in the matter.\n\nMany of the kids are as American as Miranda Lambert in every respect but place of birth: They speak English, play football and softball, post photos on Facebook and know the menu at McDonald's.\n\nSome don't even realize they're not U.S. citizens until they apply for a driver's license or a Social Security card. At that point they discover they are subject to summary deportation to a country they may not even remember.\n\nThey learn that their only future in this country is no future at all: living in the shadows, dodging the law and missing out on opportunities the native-born take for granted. It's a life sentence of exile, internal or external.\n\nThe Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act would mitigate their plight by offering them a deal. Those who have been here at least five years and arrived before the age of 16 could ask for conditional lawful permanent resident status, which would let them stay for six years. Only those who have a high school diploma or GED, \"demonstrate good moral character\" and pass a criminal background check would qualify.\n\nDuring that period, they would be free to go to college or enlist in the military. Those who do either for two years would be eligible for permanent legal status, allowing them to become citizens. Those who don't would be obligated to leave.\n\n\n\n\nBut that was before anti-immigrant fever infected the party. Lugar is facing a primary challenge from a tea party favorite endorsed by the Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee (ALIPAC) -- which has called undocumented foreigners \"Nazis\" who \"have set up ethnic cleansing zones.\" So the usually steadfast Lugar dropped the bill like a hot stove.\n\nThis is one issue where the difference between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is large and distinct. In his State of the Union address, the president endorsed the bill, imploring Congress to \"stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country.\"\n\nRomney flatly rejects the Dream Act. His sole concession is a willingness to \"study and consider\" an alternative being drafted by Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nBut even that \"compromise\" is a fraud, because it would offer no plausible avenue to citizenship. It's a diamond ring without the stone.\n\nOpponents of the Dream Act predict huge taxpayer costs as youngsters flock to public colleges at in-state rates. But why should the \"dreamers\" be barred from what their classmates can claim? It's easy to forget that though these kids are illegal, they are also blameless.\n\nThe complaint omits all the economic and fiscal rewards the change would yield. A UCLA study reported that gaining citizenship would boost the lifetime earnings of beneficiaries by a total of at least $1.4 trillion. Immigrants who get college degrees typically pay far more in taxes and require less in public assistance than they would otherwise. They're an asset, not a liability.\n\nBut that wins no points with Romney and Co. Theirs is an America where dreams go to die.\n\nSteve Chapman\n\n\n©Creators Syndicate\n",
  "response": "Here is a hyper-detailed, densely populated scene concept inspired by the themes of immigration, bureaucratic limbo, and the struggle for documentation in the \"Dream Act\" text. The scene is designed to facilitate multi-agent collaboration, reasoning, and problem-solving:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Immigration Processing Center – Records Archive & Application Hub*  \nA labyrinthine government facility where immigration applications, citizen petitions, and legal appeals are processed. The environment is inherently collaborative due to:  \n- **Physical Constraints:** Heavy file boxes, locked cabinets, and sprawling clerical stations require teamwork.  \n- **Procedural Complexity:** Applicants must navigate bureaucratic hurdles (e.g., retrieving specific documents, cross-referencing databases).  \n- **Time Pressure:** Pending cases have deadlines, forcing coordination between clerks, security, and applicants.  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Flickering fluorescent lights, the hum of dot-matrix printers, and the scent of old paper and stale coffee. The air is thick with tension—some desks are impeccably organized, others buried under chaotic stacks of files.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Key Areas**  \n**A)** **Main Reception Area** – A cramped waiting room with a bulletproof service window.  \n**B)** **Records Archive** – High shelves of numbered boxes, a rolling ladder, and locked filing cabinets.  \n**C)** **Processing Cubicles** – Clerks’ workstations with computers, scanners, and in/out trays.  \n**D)** **Security Office** – Monitors, keycard-locked doors, and a wall of confiscated items.  \n**E)** **Mailroom** – Sorting tables, sealed envelopes, and a broken postage machine.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A) Main Reception Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A steel service counter (2m long, 1m high) with a laminated \"TAKE A NUMBER\" dispenser (stuck on #73).  \n- A bolted-down bench (3 seats, cracked vinyl padding) with a chained clipboard for sign-ins.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Application Kiosk:** Touchscreen with a sticky \"OUT OF ORDER\" note, hiding a half-inserted USB drive labeled \"BACKUP_APPS.\"  \n- **Dropbox Slot:** A reinforced metal bin (30cm x 15cm) marked \"URGENT PETITIONS,\" jammed with overstuffed envelopes.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Security camera (red LED blinking, angled toward the counter).  \n- Wall-mounted pamphlet rack (empty except for a crumpled \"Know Your Rights\" flier in Spanish).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- Graffiti on the bench: \"WAIT 4 EVER\" carved into the metal.  \n- A dead potted plant (dusty silk ficus) next to a peeling \"WELCOME\" sign.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B) Records Archive**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- Industrial shelving units (3m tall, steel frames) holding 200+ numbered cardboard boxes (e.g., \"CASE #1995-042B\").  \n- A rolling library ladder (wheels squeak, one rung loose).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **\"Active Cases\" Cart:** Overloaded with 15 boxes (top one labeled \"DREAM_ACT_APPEALS\"), one teetering dangerously.  \n- **Locked Cabinet:** Digital keypad (battery low display), contains \"SENSITIVE\" files. Clue: Post-it on the side reads \"CODE = LAST 4 OF STORAGE RM #.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Broken scanner (error light flashing, paper jam).  \n- Wheeled stool (one missing caster, tilts to the left).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- Cobwebs on high shelves.  \n- A framed photo of a stern official (dusty, hanging crooked).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C) Processing Cubicles**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- Clerks’ desks (particleboard, coffee-stained) with dividers.  \n- Overhead bins labeled \"PENDING\" (overflowing), \"APPROVED\" (empty).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Stamp Set:** Missing the \"APPROVED\" stamp; inkpad dried out.  \n- **Case File:** Open on Desk #3, highlighting a discrepancy (birth certificate vs. school records).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- Dot-matrix printer (out of paper, \"ERROR\" beeping).  \n- Desk fan (oscillating, cord tangled in drawer).  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- Family photo taped to monitor (child’s doodle on the frame).  \n- Sticky notes with reminders: \"CALL IT @ 3PM,\" \"BRING FORM 17A.\"  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **\"Active Cases\" Cart:** Requires 2+ agents to stabilize while moving (weight: 80kg; unbalanced load).  \n- **Shelving Unit Ladder:** One agent must steady it while another climbs (loose rung hazard).  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among 20 nearly identical USB drives in the mailroom, the critical one has a chip on the corner and a faded \"ZETA\" label. Background clutter (e.g., rubber bands, paperclips) adds noise.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** To fix the printer:  \n  1. **Problem:** Paper jam (visible crumpled sheet).  \n  2. **Solution:** Fetch the jam-clearing tool (hanging on a hook in the mailroom).  \n  3. **Distractor:** A similar-but-wrong tool is in the security office.  \n\n---  \n\nThis environment is primed for tasks like:  \n- **Retrieving a specific case file** (requires decoding the cabinet, ladder coordination).  \n- **Resolving application discrepancies** (cross-checking documents, finding missing stamps).  \n- **Bypassing bureaucratic deadlocks** (e.g., repairing the kiosk with the USB drive).  \n\nEvery object’s state and placement creates layered challenges, while ambient clutter forces precise reasoning. Agents must collaborate to navigate the physical and procedural maze."
