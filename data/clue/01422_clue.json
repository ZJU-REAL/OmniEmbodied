That is, it will show lower and higher signals than before, assigning those more extreme values as 1 and 5 bars. This means it'll require more signal to show higher bars, with the result of the iPhone showing 5 bars less often, but also showing \"no service\" less often, too. [anandtech via macrumors]\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Telecom Field Testing Station\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA temporary **field testing station** set up in a semi-urban environment to analyze wireless signal performance after a major network upgrade. The scene is designed for **multi-agent collaboration** due to:  \n- **Distributed tasks** requiring simultaneous monitoring, calibration, and physical adjustments.  \n- **Heavy/bulky equipment** that cannot be moved alone.  \n- **Precision coordination** between signal measurement and hardware tuning.  \n\nThe station is housed in a **repurposed shipping container** with an **extended work canopy** outside, surrounded by signal towers, testing devices, and scattered tools. The environment is **lived-in**, with evidence of ongoing work—coffee cups, scribbled notes, half-assembled gear, and faint electronic hums.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe testing station consists of:  \n1. **Main Control Container** – The core workspace with monitoring equipment.  \n2. **Outdoor Canopy Workbench** – A sheltered area for hardware adjustments.  \n3. **Signal Tower Site** – A cluster of portable antenna rigs with adjustable parameters.  \n4. **Storage & Logistics Corner** – A messy zone with spare parts, crates, and transport gear.  \n5. **Field Testing Perimeter** – A marked area with signal measurement beacons.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Control Container**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **heavy-duty aluminum workbench** (2m x 1m, bolted to the floor) with **embedded cable routing channels**.  \n- A **rack-mounted server stack** (6U height, humming, LED status lights blinking erratically).  \n- A **wall-mounted 55\" monitor** displaying real-time signal heatmaps (slightly flickering).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **RF Spectrum Analyzer** (a bulky, 15kg device with a cracked casing, showing fluctuating dBm readings).  \n- **Calibration Toolkit** (open, missing the 10mm spanner, leaving only a handwritten note: \"Borrowed for Tower 3\").  \n- **Network Test Laptop** (running diagnostic software, USB dongle plugged in, battery at 17%).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Labeled Cable Spools** (red \"HIGH GAIN\", yellow \"GROUNDED\", blue \"PATCH\").  \n- **Industrial Power Strip** (one socket loose, causing intermittent power to the coffee maker).  \n- **Whiteboard** (covered in fading marker notes: \"Tower 2 azimuth +5°?? Check after 1600h\").  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A half-empty coffee pot** (stained, lukewarm, next to a sticky note: \"DO NOT DRINK – decaf\").  \n- **A stack of outdated FCC compliance manuals** (dusty, with a Post-it: \"Rev 2025??\").  \n- **A broken desk fan** (blade bent, cord wrapped hastily around the base).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Outdoor Canopy Workbench**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A weatherproof worktable** (scuffed, with oil stains and hastily drilled holes).  \n- **A retractable tool wall** (partially collapsed, some hooks empty).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Portable Signal Generator** (requires two people to lift, 25kg, currently set to 2.4 GHz mode).  \n- **Antenna Alignment Jig** (misaligned, missing one locking bolt).  \n- **Locked Pelican Case** (marked \"CALIBRATION STANDARDS\", combo lock set to 3-7-1).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Adjustable Wrench Set** (rusty, sizes labeled but out of order).  \n- **Extension Cord Reel** (partially unwound, tangled near a puddle).  \n- **Soldering Station** (cold, with a half-melted tip).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A faded \"SAFETY FIRST\" banner** (torn at one corner).  \n- **A dead potted cactus** (overwatered, soil soggy).  \n- **Discarded energy drink cans** (some still half-full).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Signal Generator (25kg, bulky)** – Requires two people to safely move from the canopy to the tower site.  \n- **Server Rack Module (18kg, awkward grip)** – Needs coordinated lifting to avoid damaging cables.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five identical-looking RF amplifiers**, only **one** has a **scratched barcode**, a **red warranty void sticker**, and **unusually warm housing**. Agents must discern this to replace the faulty unit.  \n  - The **whiteboard’s faded notes** must be cross-referenced with **logged laptop data** to verify tower adjustments.  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The locked Pelican case holds critical calibration tools.  \n  - **Solution:** The combo (3-7-1) is written on a **coffee-stained notepad** inside the control container.  \n  - **Distractor:** Multiple other numbers are scribbled nearby, requiring verification.  \n\n#### **Dynamic State Changes:**  \n- The **flickering monitor** could indicate a failing GPU **or** a loose cable—requiring diagnostics.  \n- The **misaligned antenna jig** degrades signal accuracy until repaired.  \n\nThis design ensures **dense interactivity**, **collaborative necessity**, and **layered problem-solving**—perfect for embodied AI testing.  \n\n---  \n**Final Atmosphere Note:**  \nThe scene should feel **lived-in but functional**, with a mix of **urgency and fatigue**—half-finished tasks, intermittent equipment issues, and the hum of distant radio interference. Agents must navigate **both technical and physical challenges** to succeed."
