Traffic was halted on the capital's main roads, and the cortege stopped for a ceremony at the city hall.\n\nEarlier in the day, dozens of dignitaries and hundreds of fans, some weeping, filed past the coffin at the Estádio da Luz, the stadium of Benfica, Eusébio's longtime club. Some 10,000 fans at the Stadium of Light cheered and sang when the coffin was placed in the centre of the pitch.\n\nThe government declared three days of national mourning after Eusébio's death on Sunday from heart failure. He was 71.\n\nEusébio was an international star and national hero whose heyday was in the 1960s with Benfica and the Portuguese national team. He became one of the world's top goalscorers and was widely regarded as one of the best players of all time. He was affectionately known as the Black Panther for his athletic physique and agility.\n\nThe funeral was attended by the prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, and many football players, including former world player of the year and retired Portugal captain Luis Figo, as well as Eusébio's surviving family.\n\nEusébio is to be buried in a cemetery near Benfica's stadium. Authorities said they would consider moving him later to Lisbon's National Pantheon, which contains the tombs of illustrious figures from Portuguese history.\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Memorial Stadium Preparation for a Legend's Farewell**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nThe scene is set in **Estádio da Luz**, Benfica's iconic football stadium, transformed into a **memorial site** for the funeral of a legendary player. The stadium is in the final stages of preparation for the public viewing and funeral procession, with workers, officials, and volunteers collaborating to ensure everything is perfect.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Large-scale logistics:** Moving heavy tributes, setting up barriers, adjusting lighting and sound systems.  \n- **Precision coordination:** Preparing the coffin display, floral arrangements, security checks.  \n- **Time pressure:** The event is imminent, requiring rapid yet careful execution.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Key Areas**  \nThe stadium has been repurposed into three main zones:  \n\n1. **Pitch Center (Main Memorial Site)** – The coffin is placed on a raised platform surrounded by floral wreaths. Lighting rigs and a temporary sound system are installed.  \n2. **Preparation Room (Backstage Logistics Hub)** – Storage for equipment, floral arrangements, and security supplies.  \n3. **Stadium Aisles & Entry Gates** – Crowd control barriers, media equipment, and emergency medical stations.  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Pitch Center (Main Memorial Site)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **black marble podium** (2m x 1.5m, weight: 300kg) for the coffin.  \n- **Four temporary floodlight towers** (3m tall, requiring two people to adjust).  \n- A **semi-circular floral wreath stand** (wooden, 5m wide, filled with red and white flowers).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **The coffin** (mahogany, polished, with a Benfica emblem, locked with a ceremonial key).  \n- **A velvet-lined display case** (containing Eusébio’s Golden Boot trophy, locked).  \n- **A sound mixer console** (currently in \"standby\" mode, needs an audio technician to activate).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Folding chairs** (stacked, some unfolded for dignitaries).  \n- **Portable barriers** (steel, marked \"RESERVED\" for VIP seating).  \n- **A wireless microphone** (on a stand, battery low).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Benfica banners** from past championships draped on railings.  \n- **A broken stadium seat** (marked for repair).  \n- **Loose petals** scattered near the wreaths.  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Preparation Room (Backstage Logistics Hub)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **A large metal storage rack** (holding extra floral arrangements, labeled by type).  \n- **A workbench with tools** (screwdrivers, wire cutters, duct tape).  \n- **A refrigeration unit** (for preserving fresh flowers, humming softly).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Ceremonial key** (brass, on a red lanyard, kept in a locked drawer).  \n- **Spare floodlight bulbs** (halogen, fragile, stored in foam-lined cases).  \n- **Emergency first-aid kits** (one missing bandages).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A coffee machine** (half-full, steam still rising).  \n- **A clipboard with a checklist** (\"Floral Arrangement – Complete. Sound Check – Pending\").  \n- **A wheeled cart** (scuffed, one sticky wheel).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old newspapers** (with Eusébio’s obituary circled).  \n- **A half-eaten sandwich** (wrapped in foil).  \n- **Dusty championship trophies** (on a high shelf).  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Stadium Aisles & Entry Gates**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Steel crowd barriers** (connected in segments, some not yet locked in place).  \n- **Media camera tripods** (one has a loose leg).  \n- **A temporary security checkpoint** (metal detector, beeping intermittently).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A lost-and-found box** (containing a misplaced VIP pass).  \n- **A jammed turnstile** (requires two people to reset).  \n- **A stack of event programs** (some misprinted, needing sorting).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Portable heaters** (for staff, one flickering).  \n- **A water cooler** (almost empty).  \n- **A janitor’s cart** (with cleaning supplies).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti on a pillar** (\"Eusébio Forever\").  \n- **Discarded ticket stubs** (on the ground).  \n- **A flickering neon sign** (\"Welcome to Estádio da Luz\").  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The marble podium (300kg)** requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **The jammed turnstile** needs simultaneous force from two sides to reset.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among five **floral wreaths**, one has a **loose ribbon** (needs reattachment before display).  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The **locked display case** (containing Eusébio’s Golden Boot) requires the **ceremonial key** (kept in the preparation room).  \n\nThis scene is **dense with potential tasks**, from **logistical coordination** (moving heavy objects) to **precision-based problem-solving** (fixing equipment, locating keys). The **realistic clutter** (discarded items, misprints, broken fixtures) ensures agents must **filter noise** while executing tasks.  \n\n**Final Note:** Every object has **purpose**, **state**, and **potential interactivity**, making this a **rich, dynamic environment** for multi-agent collaboration."
