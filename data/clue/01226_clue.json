Days when there are no reputation changes are normally not included, so this is either a bug or at least inconsistent behavior:\n\nenter image description here\n\nThere're several similar questions all tagged so I'm going to assume this is a new bug.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\nmarked as duplicate by animuson, Lorem Ipsum, Rory, Toon Krijthe, Martijn Pieters Nov 6 '12 at 23:30\n\n\nWhy is it a bug? –  Wesley Murch Nov 6 '12 at 22:00\nAFAIK this appears when there were reputation events on that day, but they were cancelled. For example, if you upvote a post and then undo your upvote. It will not appear on days that no reputation events occur. –  Jeremy Banks Nov 6 '12 at 22:00\n@WesleyMurch In days when there are no reputation changes the date itself isn't shown. It's either a bug or terribly inconsistent behavior. –  quantumSoup Nov 6 '12 at 22:06\nWhy is this being downvoted? –  quantumSoup Nov 6 '12 at 22:08\nPerhaps because you report a bug which doesn't seem to be one. Didn't downvote myself, so I can only guess. –  Bart Nov 6 '12 at 22:10\n@quantumSoup Don't worry about being downvoted on meta. It doesn't mean the same thing as it does on the other sites. Being downvoted on meta just means \"I disagree that this is an issue\". :) –  corsiKa Nov 6 '12 at 22:17\n@corsiKa That is only one possible interpretation of downvotes on Meta. Often correct, but not always. –  Bart Nov 6 '12 at 22:19\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 8 down vote accepted\n\nThere were no net reputation changes on this day\n\nThere was a downvote that was then reversed, there was a change you may have momentarily noticed (why we show the message at all, it's also technically very hard to remove) but no net changes on that day.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI kinda wish there was a way to show all the events (uncollapsed) like when you first pushed out the new rep-system. Of course, it should default to \"off\" since it'll be full of noise. –  Mysticial Nov 6 '12 at 22:32\n@Mysticial - It's definitely possible, maybe a clickable link on the end of that message? –  Nick Craver Nov 6 '12 at 22:34\nYeah, or a checkbox at the bottom of the rep page that will show all events. (similar to the one that shows deleted posts) –  Mysticial Nov 6 '12 at 22:35\n\nThe reputation history knows that you had one or more reputation events on the given day, whatever they may be. When you request the details, the individual reputation events are grouped so that self-cancelling events are rolled up and removed.\n\nIf this roll-up results in nothing to display, you're told that\n\nThere were no net reputation changes on this day\n\nPreviously, it simply displayed an empty set of details, which was confusing. Ideally, you wouldn't see the collapsed (or pre-expanded, as the case may be) entry to begin with, but it's cost prohibitive to know to do this for the high level view, especially for a case that's relatively rare.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Digital Reputation Archive\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA sprawling, semi-abandoned **data storage facility** that archives the digital reputation transactions of a defunct online community. The facility is a labyrinth of server rooms, administrative offices, and maintenance corridors—each filled with decaying hardware, half-functional terminals, and stacks of physical backups.  \n\n**Why is this collaborative?**  \n- **Heavy server racks** require multiple agents to move or service.  \n- **Corrupted data logs** must be cross-referenced between terminals.  \n- **Security systems** (biometric locks, keycards) mandate coordinated access.  \n- **Environmental hazards** (exposed wiring, flickering lights) force dynamic problem-solving.  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n**A. Main Server Hall**  \n- A cavernous room lined with towering server racks, each humming faintly. Overhead, a grid of flickering LED strips casts an erratic glow. The air smells of ozone and warm plastic.  \n\n**B. Admin Control Room**  \n- A glass-walled office overlooking the server hall, filled with terminals, whiteboards covered in half-erased network diagrams, and a coffee maker with a cracked carafe.  \n\n**C. Backup Vault**  \n- A reinforced chamber housing rows of **physical data cartridges** in labeled slots. A single robotic arm (partially jammed) hangs from the ceiling.  \n\n**D. Maintenance Corridor**  \n- A cramped passageway lined with tool cabinets, fuse boxes, and a leaking coolant pipe dripping into a bucket.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Server Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Server Rack Delta-7 (Weight: 450kg, Dimensions: 2.1m tall, 1m wide)** – A primary storage unit with exposed wiring. One of its cooling fans is jammed with dust.  \n- **Central Monitoring Terminal (State: Boots to a login screen, but password field is locked due to a corrupted session file)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Corrupted Data Cartridge (Label: \"UserRepLog_Nov6_2012\")** – Found ejected on the floor near Server Rack Delta-7. Requires manual insertion into a reader.  \n- **Maintenance Keycard (Location: Taped under a keyboard in the Admin Control Room)** – Needed to reboot the central terminal.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Network Diagnostic Tool (State: Functional but missing a battery)**  \n- **Fire Suppression System Control (State: Warning light blinking \"Low Pressure\")**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **dusty \"Employee of the Month\" plaque** from 2010.  \n- A **half-empty water bottle** left on a server rack.  \n- **Frayed Ethernet cables** coiled like snakes near the floor.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Admin Control Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Primary Command Desk (Weight: 120kg, Dimensions: 2m long)** – Covered in sticky notes with old login credentials.  \n- **Bulletin Board (State: Pinned with outdated security protocols and a torn \"Server Migration Schedule\")**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Biometric Scanner (State: Functional, but requires two separate admin fingerprints to override lockdown)**  \n- **Server Blueprint (Location: Inside a locked drawer; key hidden inside a hollowed-out book titled \"Networking for Dummies\")**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Working Terminal (State: Displays fragmented reputation logs)**  \n- **Printer (State: Out of paper, but has a jammed sheet inside)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **shattered \"World’s Best Sysadmin\" mug** repurposed as a pen holder.  \n- A **stack of obsolete manuals** labeled \"Legacy Database Recovery.\"  \n- A **flickering neon \"ON AIR\" sign** from an old broadcasting setup.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Backup Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Robotic Retrieval Arm (State: Stuck mid-motion, blocking access to Cartridge Slot #42)**  \n- **Data Cartridge Shelves (Weight per shelf: 80kg; some labels faded)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Cartridge #42 (Label: \"Reputation_Events_Rollup\")** – Contains the missing log entry for \"Nov 6, 2012.\"  \n- **Manual Override Lever (State: Rusted, requires two agents to pull simultaneously)**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Cartridge Cleaning Kit (State: Missing the solvent bottle)**  \n- **Emergency Flashlight (State: Batteries corroded)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **spiderweb stretching between two shelves**.  \n- A **yellowed sticky note** reading \"DO NOT USE SLOT #42 – BUGGED.\"  \n\n---  \n\n#### **D. Maintenance Corridor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Fuse Box (State: One blown fuse, labeled \"Server Hall Cooling\")**  \n- **Tool Cabinet (Weight: 60kg, requires two hands to open due to a bent hinge)**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Spare Fuse (Location: Inside a toolbox under a pile of tangled wires)**  \n- **Coolant Leak (State: Slowly spreading; requires a wrench to tighten the valve)**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Multimeter (State: Functional but missing probes)**  \n- **Extension Cord (State: Plugged in but frayed at one end)**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **graffiti tag reading \"404 ACCESS DENIED.\"**  \n- A **rusted \"Wet Floor\" sign** leaning against the wall.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Server Rack Delta-7 (450kg, 2.1m tall)** – Requires at least two agents to safely move (or risk toppling).  \n- **Manual Override Lever in Backup Vault** – Needs synchronized pulling (two agents must act simultaneously).  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among **five identical-looking data cartridges**, only the correct one has:  \n  - A **blue label** (others are red/green).  \n  - A **handwritten \"CORRUPTED – DO NOT ARCHIVE\"** note.  \n  - A **small scratch near the barcode**.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - To fix the **flickering server hall lights**, agents must:  \n    1. **Find the blown fuse** (inside the toolbox under wires).  \n    2. **Use a multimeter** (if repaired) to confirm the circuit.  \n    3. **Replace the fuse** while avoiding the leaking coolant pipe.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes**  \nThis environment is built for **emergent problem-solving**:  \n- Agents must **navigate decay and malfunction**.  \n- **Information is fragmented** across terminals, cartridges, and notes.  \n- **Physical constraints** (weight, access permissions, hazards) enforce collaboration.  \n\nThe scene is **alive with ambient storytelling**—every dusty terminal and misplaced tool hints at a larger narrative of digital abandonment."
