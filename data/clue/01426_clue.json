They use their venom to kill and aid the digestion of their prey, which mainly consists of other invertebrates such as moths, cockroaches, crickets and other species of spiders.\n\nThese spiders are mainly nocturnal and it is during this time that they do most of their hunting. They hunt by simply waiting until suitable prey ventures too close then rushing and grabbing it using their fangs.\n\nThis species sometimes share their catch, or co-operate in subduing a large insect. In this species it is not unusual to see large and small spiders feeding on the same prey side by side.\n\nBeing cold blooded, they are more active during the warmer months of the year when there is also a greater abundance of prey around.\n\nDuring this period, males and females will mate. The female lays the eggs in an egg sac, which is disk shaped and is constructed of papery white silk.\n\nOnce the young hatch, they do not disperse as with other species of huntsmans, but remain and grow within the colony.\n\nCommunal Huntsmans usually live between one and two seasons\n\n© Museum Victoria Australia\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"Nocturnal Biolab Field Station\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA remote **Nocturnal Biolab Field Station** nestled in a dense rainforest, studying rare communal arachnids (inspired by the huntsman spider’s cooperative behavior). The lab is a high-tech yet cluttered research outpost, where scientists must collaborate under time constraints before dawn—when the spiders retreat into hiding.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Shared Resources:** Limited equipment forces teamwork (e.g., one centrifuge, one specimen freezer).  \n- **Large, Heavy Objects:** Field samples, equipment crates, and emergency gear require coordinated movement.  \n- **Specialized Tasks:** Some tasks demand simultaneous actions (e.g., stabilizing a live specimen while another agent retrieves sedation tools).  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe station consists of:  \n\n1. **Main Lab Area** – A hexagonal central hub with workbenches, microscopes, and specimen containment.  \n2. **Specimen Storage & Prep Room** – A climate-controlled side chamber with refrigeration units and dissection tools.  \n3. **Field Equipment Locker** – A cramped storage nook with backpacks, traps, and emergency gear.  \n4. **Observation Deck (Outdoor Platform)** – A partially covered exterior space with UV lamps and motion-triggered cameras.  \n5. **Break Room / Field Notes Station** – A small, cluttered corner with a coffee maker, whiteboards, and scattered research papers.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Main Lab Area**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Central Research Table (2.4m x 1.2m, steel frame, scratched acrylic surface)** – Dominates the room, housing microscopes and specimen trays.  \n- **Wall-Mounted Specimen Shelves (1.8m tall, glass-fronted, locked)** – Contain live spiders in ventilated terrariums.  \n- **UV Lighting Grid (ceiling-mounted, flickering intermittently)** – Mimics moonlight to keep specimens active.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Live Specimen Jar (500mL, glass, lid slightly ajar)** – Contains a large communal huntsman spider (marked *\"D. cancerides – DO NOT OPEN\"*).  \n- **Digital Microscope (powered on, calibration drifting)** – Displays a blurry feed of spider mandibles.  \n- **Emergency Sedation Kit (small red case, locked, key missing)** – Needed if a spider escapes.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Lab PC (old, fans whirring, screen saver on)** – Open to a half-finished research document.  \n- **Pipette Set (racked, one missing)** – Used for chemical transfers.  \n- **Wireless Headset (left on table, battery low)** – For recording observations.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee Stains (dried, circular, near keyboard)** – Evidence of late-night work.  \n- **\"VENOM HANDLING PROTOCOLS\" Poster (peeling corner)** – Faded safety guidelines.  \n- **Dusty Trophy (engraved: \"Field Team 2022\")** – Forgotten on a high shelf.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Specimen Storage & Prep Room**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Freezer (1.5m tall, humming, slight frost buildup)** – Stores cryo-preserved samples.  \n- **Dissection Table (stainless steel, adjustable clamps)** – Currently holding a pinned moth specimen.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Spider Egg Sac (papery white, disk-shaped, in a petri dish)** – Labeled *\"DO NOT DISTURB – HATCHING IMMINENT\"*.  \n- **Broken Centrifuge (error code E-47 blinking)** – Requires two agents to realign the rotor.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Glove Dispenser (empty, dangling a single latex glove)** – Out of stock.  \n- **Microscope Slide Box (wooden, partially open, missing Slide #12)** – Used for specimen mounting.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old Coffee Mug (\"World’s Best Arachnologist\")** – Holding pens, not coffee.  \n- **Crumpled Field Notes (ink smudged, hard to read)** – Mentions \"unusual cooperative feeding behavior.\"  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Field Equipment Locker**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Metal Storage Rack (rusting at joints, overloaded)** – Holds crates and backpacks.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Heavy Sample Crate (80kg, marked \"FRAGILE – LIVE SPECIMENS\")** – Requires two agents to lift safely.  \n- **Malfunctioning Night-Vision Goggles (frayed wires, battery dead)** – Needed for outdoor observation.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **First Aid Kit (partially opened, missing bandages)** – Standard emergency supplies.  \n- **Foldable Insect Net (torn mesh, repairable)** – Used for field collection.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Muddy Boot Prints (leading to the door)** – From recent fieldwork.  \n- **Dusty Radio (antenna bent, off)** – Previously used for weather updates.  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Heavy Sample Crate (80kg, 1m x 0.6m)** – Requires two agents to move without spilling contents.  \n- **Industrial Freezer Door (stuck, needs simultaneous force at hinges)** – Must be opened carefully to avoid damaging specimens.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five chemical bottles**, the correct sedative is the **only one with a blue cap, handwritten \"CAUTION – FAST-ACTING\" label, and half-empty**.  \n  - **Distractor:** Nearby, a decorative blue glass paperweight could cause confusion.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The live specimen jar is **unsealed, spider at risk of escape**.  \n  - **Solution:** The **emergency sedation kit** is locked—the key is inside a **field notebook in the break room**.  \n  - **Secondary Challenge:** The notebook is buried under scattered papers, requiring search.  \n\n### **Dynamic Environmental Factors**  \n- **Flickering UV Lights** – May fail entirely, requiring manual backup lighting setup.  \n- **Humidifier Noise** – Masks subtle sounds (e.g., spider movements).  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** This scene is designed for **emergent collaboration**—agents must navigate limited resources, time pressure (dawn approaching), and hidden dependencies (keys, tools) to succeed. The density of objects ensures **perceptual complexity**, forcing precise reasoning amidst realistic clutter."
