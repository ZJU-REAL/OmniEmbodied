  "response": "# **Abandoned Wildlife Research Station – Collaborative Exploration & Restoration Scene**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** A partially abandoned wildlife research station in the Georgian wilderness, nestled near the Chattahoochee National Forest. The scene is set after a sudden evacuation—equipment is left mid-operation, field notes are scattered, and some power systems are still active. The station was once a hub for ecological studies, housing live animal specimens, biological samples, and extensive research archives.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?** The station's size, the complexity of its abandoned systems, and the fragility of remaining specimens necessitate teamwork. Agents must navigate hazards (unstable structures, malfunctioning equipment), recover critical research, and stabilize the environment before time-sensitive damage occurs.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe station consists of:  \n1. **Main Research Lab** – The heart of the facility, cluttered with half-completed experiments and specimen containers.  \n2. **Storage & Supply Room** – A cramped space with stacked crates, spare parts, and archived samples.  \n3. **Live Specimen Holding Area** – A dimly lit room with animal enclosures, some damaged.  \n4. **Field Office & Communications Hub** – A desk-strewn workspace with maps, a half-dismantled radio, and scattered field notes.  \n5. **Outdoor Observation Deck** – A weather-beaten platform overlooking the forest, with a broken telescope and rainwater-collection barrels.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Research Lab**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **steel dissection table (2m x 1m)** with adjustable clamps, currently tilted at 15° due to a missing stabilizing bolt.  \n- A **large specimen refrigeration unit (1.8m tall, 300kg)** humming faintly, its glass door fogged from intermittent cooling.  \n- A **wall-mounted whiteboard** covered in smeared marker notes and a half-erased wildlife tracking map.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed biohazard container (50cm x 30cm, 20kg, labeled \"STRAIN B-47\")**, locked with a rusted combination padlock.  \n- **A microscope with a cracked slide (containing a blood sample)** placed haphazardly near the edge of a desk.  \n- **A disconnected centrifuge (120kg, requires two agents to lift)** tipped on its side, its power cord frayed.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **lab sink with a dripping faucet**, surrounded by unwashed glassware.  \n- A **digital temperature monitor (display flickering between 12°C and ERROR)** mounted on the wall.  \n- A **wheeled cart with scattered petri dishes**, some labeled, some empty.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **faded \"PROTOCOL 7: QUARANTINE PROCEDURES\" poster** peeling off the wall.  \n- A **coffee mug with a cracked handle**, holding dried-out pens.  \n- **Dusty footprints** leading from the door to the specimen fridge.  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Storage & Supply Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial shelving units (2.5m tall, bolted to the walls)** stacked with labeled crates.  \n- **A locked metal cabinet (1m x 0.5m)** with a keypad entry (battery low).  \n- **A heavy-duty dolly (capable of 200kg load)** leaning against the wall, one wheel stuck.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A crate marked \"LIVE CULTURES – DO NOT TILT\" (60cm x 40cm, 25kg)**, slightly leaking condensation.  \n- **A toolbox with a missing 10mm wrench** (required to fix the centrifuge in the lab).  \n- **A backup generator (150kg, requires two agents to move)**, fuel gauge at 20%.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **A stack of empty sample jars** on a rolling cart.  \n- **A clipboard with a partially filled inventory sheet** (last updated weeks ago).  \n- **A functioning but dusty air vent** rattling occasionally.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A spiderweb-covered \"EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH\" certificate** from 5 years ago.  \n- **A broken office chair** missing two wheels.  \n- **A pile of outdated scientific journals** with dog-eared pages.  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The backup generator (150kg)** is too heavy for one agent—team lifting is required to relocate it to the lab for emergency power.  \n- **The centrifuge (120kg, unstable)** must be righted and moved carefully to avoid damaging sensitive components.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n#### **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n- Among **five chemical bottles on the lab shelf**, only one has a **blue cap, a handwritten \"CORROSIVE\" label, and is half-full**. However, **a decorative blue glass paperweight** on the desk creates a visual distractor, forcing careful inspection.  \n\n#### **Compound Tool-Use Reasoning:**  \n- To open the **biohazard container (locked with a combination padlock)**, agents must first find the **torn lab notebook in the field office** that contains the code snippet.  \n- The **malfunctioning radio in the communications hub** requires a **missing capacitor (found inside the locked metal cabinet in storage)**—but the cabinet's keypad is dying, so agents must act quickly before the battery fails entirely.  \n\nThis dense, layered environment ensures that no single agent can solve every problem alone—collaboration, precise reasoning, and efficient delegation are mandatory for success."
