For example, they can decide if they accept an ad with a full page giant penis in it selling v14gr4.\n\n    However, with web ads, the editors have no control over it. The advertizer has complete control of how the ad looks. And even though at the time of \"contracting\" the ad the editors may like the types of ad, maybe after a month the ad will get changed to something really annoying.\n\n    From the original forum thread, the problem was that someone's computer was slowing to a halt because some random flash ad. That sort of thing is really annoying.\n\n    I even have seen similar kind of trouble in pages of open source projects. In one of those pages, the guys used some ad service and got some kind of virus or XSS attack in one of the ads... even though the ad company was supposed to be good!\n\n  • Good Luck with That (Score:3, Interesting)\n\n    by FreeUser (11483) on Wednesday April 21, 2010 @04:46AM (#31920098)\n\n    When Obama decided that the only way out of this depression was massive spending programs, I affiliated myself with a different party.\n\n    I hope it wasn't the Republicans, since the bailout that was required to prevent a depression directly resulting from years of irresponsible lack of oversight was initiated by George W.

They fact that people go to such lengths to remove them should indicate how people feel about them. They're really no different then spam; except spam is free, so it can be profitable with abysmal response rates. Does anyone actually buy anything as result of banner ads? Sure people click them all the time, but how often is it done on purpose? The damn things are just in the way. I'm constantly accidentally tapping on ads on my iPhone, but I sure as hell have never bought anything as a result.\n\n    The thing is that even though click-through rates are bullshit the billboard space is not. If you're a semi-smart consumer you at least check a couple sites and a couple brands before picking one, but WHICH stores and WHICH brands? Oh, the ones you've been fed with the last year and are the first to pop into your mind. There's a diminishing rate of return on checking every store, every model (if such a thing even is possible) as long as you get a good deal on a good model from a reputable seller.\n\n    People think they know exactly what you want and isn't affected by ads which is only true for the things that are important to them but ignores everything that's not so important to them. I might know all the high-end CPU models but buy lots of foodstuffs and clothes and furniture and whatnot where it's not like I've gone through any exhaustive search or made a huge in-depth analysis. Nice shirt, best possible shirt purchase? No idea, but I'll buy it anyway. A fashion freak might know every deal on shirts but not have a clue of computers, this is where marketing matters.\n\n    Finally, and this is an important point about advertising - ignorance is bliss. Unless they're aware that they overpaid, they don't really care. People just think \"Cool, this 600$ computer is amazing, it's so fast and nice and 600$ wasn't much...\" even if they could have gotten it for 400$. It's only if they know that they care about the 200$ they \"lost\", not because it was poor value but because it was a poor deal. If they take the deal then stop looking because they're no longer in the market for any they are happy.\n\n    Personally, I hate shopping. If you throw a decent offer in my way I might just to be done shopping. I think these ads are trying to be much the same way, they're not just the window you glance past but the clothes rack in your way. A little obnoxious yes but at the same time something you're not able to dismiss so easily, which might lead you to stop and ahhhhhhh looked at this long enough, I'll buy something now and be done with it.

I'm surprised. What guarantee could they possibly make that would be both convincing and immutable? I say \"immutable\" because any guarantee they offer now, technical or otherwise, could easily be discarded without notice by future management.\n\n    It is wise to consider the ad companies untrusted, and decide when the risk is justified by the potential benefit.

With magazines, newspapers, radio, TV, and direct online ad sales, there is a temptation to do secret editorial-for-content deals with their product-maker customers.\n\n    Advertising is most suitable for things like classifieds and job ads.

If you want to make money with computers, the last thing you want is the user to become empowered, you need them reliant on you, the man in the middle providing a service.\n\n    Long term successful products on computers do not empower users, they make users dependent. Now, for an example, this'll go 2 ways: Windows (insightful please), MacOS (flamebait from the fanboys). But the point is valid. You don't learn about computers using those platforms, you learn about those platforms.

Nobody claimed it was a crime, it's merely a policy that such things aren't discussed openly (if anything, that line from the terms suggests to me that ad blocking is implicitly tolerated so long as you don't openly talk about it, there's no mention of not ad blocking, just not promoting ad blocking - no doubt because the advertisers might be alarmed if they saw such talk in the forums).\n\n    As for who the customers are, follow the money - the advertisers are the ones paying for the user views, the advertisers and users who pay a subscription are the customers.\n\n  • Re:Troublesome ads (Score:3, Interesting)\n\n    by SharpFang (651121) on Wednesday April 21, 2010 @06:30AM (#31920702) Homepage Journal\n\n    My former employer had an interesting policy on \"wrong ads\". You purchase a time slot for displaying your ad in a box on the page. The ad must conform to strict guidelines. If you violate the guidelines, the ad gets removed immediately and without notice. You still have the time slot and can post another ad, or the same, fixed - but the clock is ticking, and the ads there being helluva expensive, you'd better pay a close attention to the guidelines.\n\n    Yep, I've spotted one non-conforming one once.

The problem with all this is that these are the gatekeepers between malware ads and that ad showing up on a website.\n\n    Their idea of \"QA\" is to load an ad up in the ad serving software, look at it, click on it, and make sure it only loops/animates within the guidelines.

Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **A mini-fridge** (labeled *\"NOT FOOD – LIQUID COOLANT\"*, but actually storing energy drinks).  \n- **A jury-rigged fire suppression system** (a CO₂ extinguisher duct-taped to a motion sensor).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **A \"Wall of Shame\"** – Printouts of the most obnoxious ads ever blocked.  \n- **Dusty 56k modems** stacked like trophies.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances & Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **The \"Big Iron\" Server (Weight: 98kg, Dimensions: 1.5m tall)**  \n  - Requires two agents to lift onto the rack. One must stabilize while the other bolts it in.  \n- **The EMP Cage (Locked, 30kg)**  \n  - A Faraday cage holding hacked ad-tech. Two agents must align keys to open.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five identical USBs** on the desk, only **one** has a **scratched-off label** and **feels slightly warmer** (active data transfer).  \n  - Distractor: A **decoy USB** inside a **fake soda can** in the fridge.  \n- **Compound Tool Use:**  \n  - Problem: A **locked Vault** with a **voiceprint scanner**.  \n  - Solution: The **voiceprint bypass tool** is hidden inside the **gutted cash register**, but needs **soldering to repair**.  \n\n#### **Dynamic States for Chaos**  \n- A **leaking coolant pipe** (drips onto exposed wiring, risking a short).  \n- A **glitching monitor** that occasionally displays **corporate IPs sniffing the network**.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Why This Works for AI Agents**  \n- **Physical Collaboration:** Heavy objects, timed actions, and security measures demand coordination.  \n- **Layered Puzzles:** Agents must filter signal from noise (e.g., warm USB vs. decoys).  \n- **Environmental Storytelling:** The hideout’s design *implies* tasks (e.g., the killswitch begs to be used).  \n\nThis scene turns **ad-blocking debates** into a **tactical heist**, where every object has a role—and every role requires teamwork.  \n\nWould you like additional refinements (e.g., soundscape details, hidden compartments)?"
