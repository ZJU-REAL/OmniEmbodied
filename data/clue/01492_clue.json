Photograph: David Cheskin/PA\n\nAn independent Scotland would miss out on billions of pounds in overseas trade deals being brokered by the UK government, William Hague has said.\n\nThe foreign secretary said the UK government was stepping up its efforts to win new export markets and sign major trade deals through its 267 embassies and diplomatic posts around the world, backed up with £1.5bn in new export aid for British firms.\n\nSpeaking to an audience of businesspeople and academics in Edinburgh, Hague said a vote for independence would exclude Scotland from sharing in these deals, damaging major industries such as Scotch whisky and green technologies.\n\nThe Foreign Office had made overseas trade one of its top three priorities, recruiting 300 more diplomats to promote export deals in high growth markets in Asia, South America and Africa, opening up a string of new trade and diplomatic offices, he said.\n\nDavid Cameron, the prime minister, had directly persuaded the Chinese government to protect Scotch whisky imports while British diplomats were focusing heavily on bringing down 600 other trade barriers against whisky worldwide, Hague added.\n\n\"I believe that those who say Scotland would be better going it alone in foreign policy are deeply misguided,\" he said.\n\n\"They claim that the UK's foreign policy and overseas representation is focused too much on status and power, and not enough on trade and investment.\n\n\"They argue that our extensive overseas network is merely a legacy of empire, rather than something that serves the interest of all the UK's citizens; and they say that Scotland's core interests would be better served as a separate state.\n\n\"They are wrong on each and every count.\"\n\nHague's warnings are an effort to counter Alex Salmond's success as Scotland's first minister in building up Scotland's own trading partnerships and trade deals, independent of the Foreign Office and other Whitehall departments.\n\nSalmond has led delegations to major markets such as China, the United States, Germany and India as first minister, using Scotland's own network of trade offices in 18 countries – many of which are based in British embassies.\n\nScotland is now the UK's second largest recipient for inward investment deals after London and the south-east. A study by Ernst and Young earlier this month said the number of foreign investments in Scotland had hit its highest level in 15 years, taking Scotland's UK share to 10%. The number of jobs created, however, had fallen by 18%.\n\nHague said that success was in part down to the UK's huge global reach and influence, which would end with independence. More than 500 Scottish firms had used the UK Trade & Investment (UKTI) export agency, which has over 1,000 staff in 100 countries, last year.\n\n\"This means Scotland enjoys the flexibility of a smaller nation targeting its resources in specific areas, while also having the strength and certainty of the worldwide reach provided by UKTI,\" Hague said.\n\nBy contrast, it would take an independent Scotland many years and tens of millions of pounds to build up a comparable trade and diplomatic network.\n\n\"As part of the United Kingdom Scotland derives - and will continue to derive - many benefits from being part of this global diplomatic network, instead of having to rely on inevitably fewer, smaller embassies which would take time and resources to establish,\" Hague said.\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Diplomatic Trade Negotiation Hub\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA high-stakes **International Trade Negotiation Hub** housed within a historic embassy building, where diplomats, trade delegates, and corporate representatives convene to broker multi-billion-dollar export agreements. The setting is inherently collaborative—negotiations require coordination between legal advisors, interpreters, logistics experts, and security personnel. The scene is dense with documents, secure communication devices, and cultural artifacts, making it ripe for multi-agent problem-solving (e.g., locating a missing contract, decoding a sealed dossier, securing a last-minute trade concession).  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Complex Objects:** Secure briefcases, locked filing cabinets, and fragile diplomatic gifts require multiple agents to transport.  \n- **Information Dependency:** Documents are scattered across offices, requiring coordinated retrieval.  \n- **Time Pressure:** Deadlines (e.g., a ticking countdown on a digital trade agreement timer) incentivize parallel task execution.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe hub consists of four interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Main Negotiation Chamber** – A grand, wood-paneled room with a circular negotiation table, translator booths, and wall-mounted digital trade maps.  \n2. **Secure Document Vault** – A reinforced room with biometric locks, containing classified trade agreements.  \n3. **Diplomatic Lounge** – A quieter space for informal discussions, stocked with refreshments and cultural gifts from negotiating nations.  \n4. **Logistics & Communications Room** – A tech-heavy area with printers, encrypted fax machines, and a wall of monitors tracking global trade routes.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Negotiation Chamber**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **10-seat mahogany negotiation table**, polished but with visible water-ring stains from previous meetings.  \n- **3 Translator booths**, soundproofed, each with a headset rack and a small monitor displaying live captions.  \n- **Wall-mounted LED trade map**, displaying real-time import/export flows between negotiating countries.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Sealed dossier (blue leather-bound, gold-embossed \"CONFIDENTIAL\")** – Contains the latest draft of a whisky trade agreement, but missing its appendix.  \n- **Digital signature pad** – Requires fingerprint authorization from two delegates to finalize terms.  \n- **Fragile cultural gift (Ming-style porcelain vase)** – Must be carefully transported to the lounge as a goodwill gesture.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Projector with a stuck slide** – Displaying outdated tariff rates; needs manual adjustment.  \n- **Coffee carafe (half-full, lukewarm)** – On a side table with stained porcelain cups.  \n- **Broken chair (third from the left)** – Slightly unstable; risks collapsing if leaned on.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed portraits of past ambassadors** – One hangs crookedly.  \n- **Dusty potted fern** – Barely alive, in a cracked ceramic planter.  \n- **Scattered notepads** – Some with hastily scribbled negotiation points.  \n\n---\n\n#### **B. Secure Document Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Floor-to-ceiling steel filing cabinets**, each with biometric palm scanners.  \n- **Motion-activated security camera** – Blinking red LED indicates active surveillance.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Misplaced contract (labeled \"Annex B - Scotch Tariffs\")** – Stuck behind a cabinet, barely visible.  \n- **Sealed evidence bag (marked \"BREACH ATTEMPT 04/12\")** – Contains a tampered USB drive.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Industrial shredder** – Jammed with a half-destroyed document.  \n- **Wall clock (5 minutes fast)** – Creates urgency misperception.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated \"TOP SECRET\" posters** – Faded from sun exposure.  \n- **Empty takeout containers** – Left by a careless night-shift worker.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- The **Ming vase (8kg, 50cm tall, wrapped in silk)** is too delicate for one agent to carry alone—requires synchronized lifting to avoid damage.  \n- The **negotiation table (300kg, 4m diameter)** must be rotated to access a hidden power outlet, necessitating a 3-agent push.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five dossiers** in the vault, the correct one is uniquely identifiable by:  \n    - A **red wax seal** (others use blue).  \n    - A **scuffed corner** from a prior drop.  \n    - **Handwritten \"HAGUE-APPROVED\"** on the spine.  \n  - **Distractor:** A decorative **red-sealed book** in the lounge (a guest registry) adds noise.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The projector is stuck.  \n  - **Solution:** The remote is **locked in a drawer** (key hidden under a coffee stain-stained napkin).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes:**  \nThis scene thrives on **urgency, precision, and diplomacy**. The density of interactive objects, layered security measures, and cultural nuances ensure that agents must **communicate, delegate, and problem-solve dynamically**—mirroring the high-stakes trade negotiations from the inspiration text.  \n\nWould you like additional refinements (e.g., adding audio/thermal details)?"
