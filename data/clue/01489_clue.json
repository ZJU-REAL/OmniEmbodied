Let's fix them.\n\n\nThis engraving from the pages of a 1870s Harper's magazine shows Washington, D.C., with nearly the same height restrictions we have today; WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n\nIf D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray and Rep. Darrell Issa get their way, Congress may finally relax the 102-year-old law that limits most building heights in Washington D.C. to no more than 130 feet. This would be a victory for good urban planning in the District, though a small one: Gray and Issa are saying that in most cases only about one additional story of development would be allowed.\n\nBut the real crisis of land use in Washington goes way beyond the height limit. It's that the District's planning and zoning apparatus is overall hostile to new development, usually allowing far less building that would be permitted by the Heights of Buildings Act of 1910. And while D.C.'s planning rules are restrictive, they are also arbitrary and unevenly enforced, making it a difficult market to enter.\n\n\nBefore I worked in public policy, I spent three years as a commercial real estate lending analyst for Wells Fargo. Nearly all of the project financings I worked on were in either New York City or Washington. And while both of these are expensive real estate markets with lots of rules about land use, there was a big difference between the two: New York, unlike Washington, has rule of law in land use.\n\nMost development in New York City is done as-of-right. That means that, for any given piece of land, you can pick up a copy of the zoning declaration and figure out what you will be able to build: how many square feet of building area, how far it has to be set back from the street, how much parking, what kinds of uses, and so on. The incentive programs are also formulaic. For example, you get density bonuses in exchange for building public plazas.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule. Most importantly, Manhattan has seen an unfortunate proliferation of \"historic districts,\" where designs must be approved by a board of busybodies who will decide whether your plans for your property fit the neighborhood's character. Increasingly, these districts are being expanded to include vacant lots, and even a BP gas station on Houston Street, which recently needed historic district approval to change the doors on a storage shed.\n\nBut New York's historic districts, and the discretionary approvals they necessitate, are an exception to the usual development process. In D.C., a discretionary and arbitrary approval process is the norm for developments of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is normal for development projects in Washington, D.C. to obtain zoning variances or to go through a Planned Unit Development process, in which normal zoning rules are overridden. Officials in Washington tend to think of this as a strength of their planning process. The city shows \"flexibility,\" approving extra development where the developer can demonstrate benefits to the community.\n\nPresented by\n\n\nSaving the Bees\n\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\n\n\nHow to Cook Spaghetti Squash (and Why)\n\n\n\nBefore Tinder, a Tree\n\n\n\nThe Health Benefits of Going Outside\n\nPeople spend too much time indoors.

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Urban Planning Puzzle Office\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA chaotic urban planning office in Washington, D.C., where a team of planners, architects, and consultants must collaboratively navigate the city’s labyrinthine zoning laws to approve or deny development projects. The office is a microcosm of the city itself—cluttered with documents, models, and competing priorities. The environment demands multi-agent collaboration due to:  \n- **Physical constraints** (heavy blueprints, large-scale models, locked filing cabinets).  \n- **Information complexity** (scattered legal documents, conflicting stakeholder notes).  \n- **Time pressure** (deadline-driven approvals, last-minute revisions).  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe office is divided into **four interconnected zones**:  \n1. **Main Planning Hub** – A central workspace with drafting tables, zoning maps, and a large 3D city model.  \n2. **Legal & Archive Nook** – Tightly packed with filing cabinets, legal binders, and a locked safe containing original zoning laws.  \n3. **Review & Meeting Corner** – A cluttered meeting space with whiteboards, coffee stains, and a projector.  \n4. **Model Workshop** – A side room filled with scale models of proposed buildings, scattered tools, and half-finished prototypes.  \n\n#### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n---  \n### **1. Main Planning Hub**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **9ft x 5ft drafting table** with a pinned-down **vintage 1910 zoning map** (yellowed edges, coffee stains).  \n- A **1:500 scale 3D city model** (foam core, some buildings removable, marked with colored pins).  \n- **Overhead projector** (dusty lens, slightly misaligned).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Height Variance Request\" blueprints** (rolled, rubber-banded, labeled \"URGENT – 140ft Proposal\").  \n- **A locked binder** (stamped \"CONFIDENTIAL – Legal Precedents\") with a missing key.  \n- **A magnifying glass** (scratched lens) placed atop a **microfiche reader** (out of order, sticky note: \"Call IT\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Desk lamp** (flickering LED, adjustable arm).  \n- **Stapler** (jammed, half-loaded).  \n- **Coffee machine** (on, half-full carafe, \"OUT OF ORDER\" sign taped over).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed newspaper clipping** (\"1910 Height Act Passed!\").  \n- **Dead potted fern** (dusty, leaning precariously).  \n- **Sticky notes** (handwritten reminders: \"Call Darrell’s office,\" \"Zoning variance due Friday\").  \n\n---  \n### **2. Legal & Archive Nook**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Four steel filing cabinets** (rusted handles, labeled \"1910-1950,\" \"1951-1980,\" etc.).  \n- **A fireproof safe** (small, digital keypad, beeping intermittently).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Historic District Exemptions\" folder** (misplaced in the wrong cabinet).  \n- **A brass key** (hidden under a stack of **outdated zoning codes**).  \n- **A microfiche cassette** (label peeled off, contents unknown).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Wheeled office chair** (one broken caster).  \n- **Desk fan** (humming loudly, oscillating unevenly).  \n- **Landline phone** (off-hook, faint dial tone).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed portrait of a 1920s mayor** (dusty, crooked).  \n- **Dusty law degree** (hanging slightly askew).  \n- **Empty coffee cups** (some with lipstick stains).  \n\n---  \n### **3. Review & Meeting Corner**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Whiteboard** (smudged, half-erased notes: \"Community objections? Parking minimums?\").  \n- **Projector screen** (slightly torn at one corner).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A USB drive** (labeled \"FINAL DRAFT – DO NOT DELETE\") plugged into a laptop (sleeping, battery at 12%).  \n- **A red marker** (drying out, used to circle \"VIOLATION\" on a blueprint).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Conference phone** (muted, blinking \"ON CALL\").  \n- **Water cooler** (empty jug, plastic cups scattered).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Fake potted plant** (dusty, one leaf missing).  \n- **Cheap motivational poster** (\"TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK\").  \n\n---  \n### **4. Model Workshop**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Workbench** (cluttered with X-Acto knives, glue guns, foam scraps).  \n- **Shelving unit** (holding half-painted building models).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **A 3ft tall scale model of a proposed skyscraper** (unstable base, needs reinforcement).  \n- **A missing scale figure** (needed for presentation, last seen in a drawer).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Hot glue gun** (cooling, plugged in but not turned off).  \n- **Measuring tape** (retracted halfway).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Dusty architectural magazines** (stacked haphazardly).  \n- **Broken miniature tree** (from a diorama, snapped at the base).  \n\n---  \n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The 3D city model** (foam core, **1.5m x 0.8m, fragile**) requires two agents to safely move.  \n- **The filing cabinet** (top drawer **jammed**, bottom drawer **overstuffed with documents**) requires coordination to open fully.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among **five legal binders**, only one has a **blue spine, handwritten \"PRE-1950 EXEMPTIONS\" label, and a torn corner**. The others are nearly identical except for small differences (e.g., one has a coffee stain, another a faded gold stamp).  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The **locked safe** (keypad malfunctioning) requires:  \n  1. Finding the **brass key** (hidden under outdated codes).  \n  2. Using it on the **confidential binder** to retrieve a **code sheet**.  \n  3. Inputting the code into the safe to access the **original 1910 Height Act documents**.  \n\n### **Final Notes:**  \nThis environment is **dense with interactive possibilities**—agents must **collaborate to lift, search, decode, and negotiate** amidst bureaucratic chaos. The **background clutter** (coffee cups, dead plants, sticky notes) adds realism and forces precision in object identification. **Every object has a purpose**, whether functional, atmospheric, or a puzzle piece waiting to be used.  \n\n**Potential Tasks:**  \n- \"Retrieve the variance request before the deadline.\"  \n- \"Fix the projector for the client meeting.\"  \n- \"Find legal precedent to justify a height exemption.\"  \n- \"Repair the unstable skyscraper model.\"  \n\nThe scene is **ripe for multi-agent problem-solving**—whether through teamwork, tool use, or navigating bureaucratic red tape."
