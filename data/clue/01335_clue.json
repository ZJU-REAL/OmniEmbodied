I can't really wrap my head around creating a class, which will work for both melee and ranged weapons.\n\nExample given, that you have a knife, an RPG, and you have an ordinary pistol. How would you go around creating a class all three can inherit from?\n\nshare|improve this question\nThink about what they have in common and what is dfferent for each of them. That's the first step. –  Maik Semder Sep 14 '11 at 14:07\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 5 down vote accepted\n\nThe same way you design any inheritance structure: You think about what all weapons, without exception, have in common. Obviously, damage comes to mind. Attack rate. Remember that you don't have to (and should not!) cramp everything into the base class. You put into a class what you need it (and all child classes) to do, no more and no less.\n\nNext step, you could make 2 classes, MeleeWeapon and RangedWeapon, which both inherit from Weapon. Maybe that split is necessary because a MeleeWeapon has no range, and/or only a RangedWeapon uses ammunition. Then you repeat the above process for each of those classes, until you have all classes you need.\n\nAt every branch, you should also consider if you really need to split into 2 or more classes. For example, melee weapons could also have a meaningful range, such as spear vs. dagger, or your ranged weapons could have infinite ammo. That totally depends on your game design and cannot be generalized.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you very much, I have some quick drafts for some classes now :) –  meth0d_ Sep 14 '11 at 15:14\n-1, while your first paragraph I agree with, the rest of your answer trends towards the very outmoded and out-of-favor inheritance-heavy approach to design. –  Josh Petrie Sep 14 '11 at 15:24\nJust want to add that every weapon has a range. If a melee weapon would have a range of less or equal 0 it would not hit anything! –  Marco Sep 14 '11 at 16:13\n@Marco An example where 0 range works: In a grid based system, the range represents how many squares away the target can be. 0 squares away is adjacent. 1 square away is any adjacent to the adjacent squares, and etc. What \"0\" means is a design specific question, and can be a valid value for range. –  normanthesquid Sep 14 '11 at 17:39\n@normanthesquid yes, I see, special cases. To Hackworth: It's not off-topic, since you were giving a statement in your answer and I thought that it would not be right; That's the matter with comments. Anyways, I still think that a range has to be defined (0 is also a value) to check any collisions with any entity. However, my understanding of range might actually differ from yours, so we should just stop discussing here. –  Marco Sep 14 '11 at 18:18\n\nTo add to Hackworth's answer, with regard to damage and attack rate, in an RPG there are also modifiers to abilities. A heavy weapon may actually reduce your strength or dexterity, and give you negative modifiers. However, instead of thinking about having all weapons inheriting your modifiers, create a Modifier interface and implementation that has getters/setters for those modifiers. Now your Weapon interface should have a getter/setter for your Modifier object. This favors composition over inheritance when it makes sense.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nIt should certainly be possible to create a single class that represents all weapons equally well -- and this is ideal, because allowing yourself to fall into the trap of creating many subclasses for each weapon type is cumbersome. Composition(*) should be favored over inheritance.\n\nThe big challenges are going to be\n\n  1. Enumerating the set of data and behavior that you expect of all classifications of weapon.\n  2. Determining how to abstract that data and behavior into a data-oriented approach.\n\n\"Range\" is a good example -- both swords and guns both have a range. You can either elect to use a simple system when a range of 0 just means \"melee\" or you can use a real-world measurement so as to (as suggested by another poster), gives daggers a shorter reach than a polearm.\n\nBehavior can be handled by scripting(**). You could have an \"on-activated\" script object that was invoked when the weapon was used or swung -- the script for a melee weapon would look at the range, and the location of the actor using the weapon and perhaps compute the set of targets in an semi-circle in front of the actor and apply damage to each. Conversely the script for a gun might do a raycast from the actor, limited by the range.\n\n(*) This does not strictly imply that you have to rely on \"component oriented\" systems to effectively avoid going crazy with inheritance.\n\n(**) Either via scripts loaded from another language, like Lua, or by pointing the weapon at a C++ \"Script\" class which you do create subclasses of. The latter is obviously easier, but lacks some of the benefits of a scripting system as it requires recompilation, for example.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Weapon Prototyping & Testing Laboratory*  \nA high-tech R&D facility dedicated to designing, assembling, and stress-testing experimental weapon systems (melee, ranged, hybrid). The lab is structured to inherently require multi-agent collaboration due to:  \n- **Heavy/Precision Machinery** (requiring coordinated operation)  \n- **Safety Protocols** (mandating synchronized actions to prevent accidents)  \n- **Modular Workflows** (assembly, calibration, and testing split across specialized zones)  \n\n**Atmosphere:** A blend of sterile engineering precision (neon-lit workbenches, holographic schematics) and chaotic workshop energy (scorch marks from failed tests, half-dismantled prototypes). The hum of power converters mixes with sporadic weapon discharge echoes from the testing range.  \n\n---  \n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Assembly Bay** – Central open space with reinforced worktables. Overhead cranes and tool racks line the walls.  \n2. **Ranged Testing Tunnel** – A 20m-long ballistic corridor with target drones, laser tripwires, and a blast-resistant observation booth.  \n3. **Melee Calibration Chamber** – A padded room with force sensors embedded in walls, a weapon durability rig, and a shattered practice dummy.  \n4. **Component Vault** – A locked room with modular weapon parts (barrels, grips, energy cores) in labeled drawers.  \n5. **Control Room** – Glass-walled overlook with terminals displaying real-time weapon diagnostics.  \n\n---  \n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Assembly Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A 4m-long **reinforced alloy worktable** (bolted to floor, scorch marks near the eastern edge).  \n- **Overhead gantry crane** (2-ton capacity, remote control panel missing its safety cover).  \n- **Wall-mounted tool grid** (magnetic strips holding 27 specialized implements).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Project Chimera\" Prototype** (a disassembled hybrid weapon: plasma-edged bayonet attached to a railgun base, missing its coolant canister).  \n- **Calibration Jig** (clamps a weapon in place; currently set to \"melee mode,\" displaying \"ERROR: KINETIC FEEDBACK OVERLOAD\").  \n- **Hazardous Materials Bin** (locked, containing a cracked **uranium-depleted slug cartridge**, leaking faint radioactivity).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **3D Printer** (active, 78% complete printing a polymer grip; display shows \"NOZZLE CLOGGED\" warning).  \n- **Power Converter Stack** (three units humming; one has a flickering \"VOLTAGE UNSTABLE\" LED).  \n- **Autonomous Welder Drone** (idle, welding arm retracted, battery at 12%).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti-style schematic** on whiteboard: \"MK-IV CQC Mod: DO NOT TEST WITHOUT ARMOR.\"  \n- **Coffee cup** (stained with coolant fluid, used to hold calibration screws).  \n- **\"Days Since Last Incident\" counter** (digitally frozen at \"0\").  \n\n---  \n#### **2. Ranged Testing Tunnel**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Target Array** (10 robotic drones on tracks, 3 stuck at the 15m mark).  \n- **Blast Shield** (transparent polycarbonate, one cracked panel taped over).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Railgun Prototype #7** (mounted on a bench, status screen reads \"READY: AWAITING FIRE COMMAND\").  \n- **Emergency Shutdown Lever** (requires two agents to pull simultaneously).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Ammo Hopper** (half-filled with tungsten darts, jammed feed mechanism).  \n- **Thermal Camera** (overheating, displaying ghost images of past shots).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Bullet-riddled poster** of a safety inspector frowning.  \n- **Pile of spent casings** (some still warm).  \n\n---  \n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n**Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The Uranium Bin (150kg, 1.2m³)**: Requires two agents to move (radiation shielding mandates synchronized handling).  \n- **Overhead Crane Payload (2-ton railgun assembly)**: One agent must operate controls while another guides the load.  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning**: Five **energy cores** in the vault:  \n  - *Only one* has a **blue housing**, **\"HYPERION-7\" etching**, and **34% charge**.  \n  - **Distractor**: Decorative blue coolant tanks nearby.  \n- **Compound Tool-Use**:  \n  - *Problem*: Locked Component Vault (biometric scanner).  \n  - *Solution*: **Engineer’s severed thumb** (in a jar in the Control Room fridge, labeled \"BACKUP ACCESS\").  \n\n---  \n**Design Intent**: Every object’s state invites intervention (e.g., the jammed ammo hopper begs for a multitool from the Assembly Bay). The lab’s controlled chaos ensures agents must *navigate* clutter, *interpret* ambiguous cues (e.g., the \"safe\" core vs. decorative tanks), and *collaborate* under time pressure (e.g., the railgun’s overheating warning)."
