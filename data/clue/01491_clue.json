Photograph: Joseph Devenney/Getty Images\n\nThe over-50s are calling for a tax on chewing and bubble gum to help fund a clean-up campaign and encourage the use of degradable natural gum, according to research by Saga.\n\nOf the 14,000 people that responded to the Saga Populus Panel, 82% supported the idea of a levy on synthetic gum: 21% thought a 1p tax per piece of gum was appropriate, while 20% thought 10p per piece was reasonable.\n\nBritons are estimated to chew about 1bn pieces of gum a year, so a 10p levy would raise £100m towards the £150m clean-up costs paid by local councils. More importantly, Saga says, a tax that pushes up the cost of a pack of Wrigleys Extra gum (10 pieces) from its rrp of 35p to £1.35 could persuade consumers to switch to biodegradable gum – the only kind available until the 1950s.\n\nWrigley claims that taxing gum would make the litter problem even worse. \"Research shows that consumers claim they would be more likely to drop gum as they feel they have already paid for the clean up,\" it said.\n\nIt also points out that natural gum degrades no faster than synthetic, and is actually a lot more sticky and could lead to sustainability problems in terms of forestry.\n\nUnsurprisingly, its approach to the issue doesn't involve making the product more expensive: \"Gum litter is caused by the irresponsible behaviour of a small minority of chewers who need to be educated to dispose of their litter properly.\n\n\"Consequently, we believe that a fully integrated approach encompassing education and enforcement is required to tackle this issue in an effective and sustainable manner.\"\n\nBut Emma Soames, editor at large for Saga Magazine, maintains that a tax is the right way forward: \"Look along many of our nation's high streets and you see polka dot pavements caused by gum. It costs local taxpayers millions each year to clean up the worst of the mess, and probably costs businesses and individuals much more.\n\n\"If each pack of synthetic gum was increased to cost 50p more it would encourage miscreant masticators to think twice about spitting it on the floor and encourage them to seek out a natural biodegradable alternative. It might also make them more careful about how they dispose of it.\"\n\nSaga claims that despite the best efforts of chewing gum providers and campaign groups, too many people still adopt the \"spit and go\" approach to disposal, and that it wasn't surprising that Londoners were most in favour of the chewing gum tax.\n\nReally? I walk around London all the time and can't remember the last time my feet were stuck to the pavement by a glob of grey, or I inadvertantly wedged my fingers into someone else's soggy offering under a seat or table. And a straw poll of people at the Guardian has produced similar results.\n\nOur office is near King's Cross – surely stations are prime areas for gum chewing? So either councils are being super efficient at removing gum (hard to believe when they don't notice potholes the size of an asteroid crater), or people are already disposing of their gum more considerately – either by putting it in a bin or swallowing it.\n\nWhich begs a question for you to chew over: does this survey simply reflect grumpy 50-somethings resenting the mastications of a younger generation?\n\nToday's best video\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *Municipal Cleanup & Public Works Hub*  \n**Core Concept:** A bustling, multi-functional public works facility tasked with managing urban cleanliness—specifically, the removal and prevention of chewing gum litter. The environment is inherently collaborative due to the scale of operations: teams must coordinate cleanup efforts, maintain specialized equipment, and manage public outreach. The scene blends gritty realism (gum-stained streets, overflowing bins) with high-tech solutions (biodegradable gum research, cleaning drones).  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy Equipment:** Some cleanup tools require two operators (e.g., steam cleaners, bulk waste lifters).  \n- **Specialized Roles:** Chemists analyze gum samples, drone pilots map litter hotspots, outreach workers prepare educational materials.  \n- **Time Pressure:** Simulated \"shift changes\" and urgent cleanup requests force task delegation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Main Operations Floor**  \n   - Open-plan workspace with maps of high-gum-density zones.  \n   - Atmosphere: Fluorescent lighting, the hum of computers, the occasional clatter of tools.  \n\n2. **Cleanup Equipment Bay**  \n   - Garage-like space with bulky machinery.  \n   - Atmosphere: Smell of antiseptic cleaners, oily rags, and rubber tires.  \n\n3. **Biodegradable Gum Research Lab**  \n   - Small but dense with lab equipment.  \n   - Atmosphere: Sterile but cluttered, with pinned-up chemical formulas.  \n\n4. **Public Outreach Office**  \n   - Cozy but chaotic, filled with posters and pamphlets.  \n   - Atmosphere: Coffee stains, the rustle of paper, a ticking wall clock.  \n\n5. **Break Room**  \n   - Overlooked but critical for shift coordination.  \n   - Atmosphere: Fridge hum, microwave beeps, a faded \"Clean Streets!\" poster.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main Operations Floor**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **central command table** (3m x 2m, scratched laminate surface) with a pinned city map dotted with red gum-litter markers.  \n- **Floor-to-ceiling shelving units** (steel, bolted to walls) holding cleanup kits and spare parts.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Gum Heat Scanner** (on the table): A handheld device with a cracked screen, needs recalibration.  \n- **Priority Cleanup List** (pinned to a corkboard): A paper sheet with coffee rings, listing 10 urgent sites.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Printer** (out of magenta ink, jammed tray).  \n- **Radio** (static-y, tuned to a local weather station).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Gum-Free Zone\" stickers** peeling off the walls.  \n- **A dead potted cactus** on a filing cabinet.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Cleanup Equipment Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Industrial Steam Cleaner** (1.5m tall, 300kg, requires two people to move).  \n- **Tool Wall** (pegboard with outlined shapes for missing wrenches).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Gum Scraper Cart** (wheels squeak, one handle loose).  \n- **Hazardous Waste Bin** (sealed, biohazard sticker, 3/4 full).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Workbench** (stained with solvent spills).  \n- **Locked Supply Cabinet** (key missing, contains spare gloves).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Graffiti** on the wall: \"Gum = Evil.\"  \n- **Dirty boot prints** leading to the exit.  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Industrial Steam Cleaner (300kg):** Requires two agents to lift (embedded handles on either side).  \n- **Gum-Sample Cooler (50kg, awkward shape):** Needs one agent to stabilize while another opens the lid.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five chemical bottles in the lab, only **Bottle #3** has a **blue cap, \"CORROSIVE\" label, and is half-full**—but it’s surrounded by decorative blue glass vases (distractors).  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The **locked supply cabinet** (problem) requires a key last seen in the **break room fridge** (solution), under a moldy sandwich (obstacle).  \n\n---  \n\nThis environment is **dense with intentional detail**, ensuring every object can anchor a task while the ambient \"noise\" (e.g., dead cactus, peeling stickers) adds realism and cognitive challenge. Agents must navigate physical collaboration, precise attribute matching, and multi-step tool retrieval—all against the ticking clock of urban decay."
