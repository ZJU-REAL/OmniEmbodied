Going to my flair json link now, I'm getting back:\n\n \"displayName\":\"Jon Skeet\",\n\nIs this deliberate, and are there any plans to reinstate the previous flair?\n\nI'm aware that everything I'm using is pre-API... should I just take the plunge and just use the proper API instead? :)\n\n(I've tagged this as \"bug\" on the grounds of it possibly being unintentional. None of the others particularly seemed to fit other than perhaps support. Feel free to retag appropriately.)\n\nshare|improve this question\n@Jeff: I'm nitpicking but this should be status-bydesign not status-declined, since this is not a feature proposal but a bug.. –  Andreas Bonini Mar 2 '11 at 19:49\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nFollowing the got flair link on a user profile to reach the User Flair page, and then scrolling right to the bottom and you can see:\n\nWhat about the old, non image based flair?\n\n\nshare|improve this answer\nGah - hadn't seen that. I guess that answers that, although it's frankly annoying as I really don't want to serve an image link as part of the rep tracker. Most users know what their own faces look like, and having all the information in a single response is handy over 3G. Will look at whether the API makes this easier... –  Jon Skeet Mar 2 '11 at 12:40\n@Jon, FYI, it looks like this probably changed back in September. (On a re-read, I feel I should clarify that I mean September was the introduction of the current image version and probably the time the others were deprecated). –  DMA57361 Mar 2 '11 at 12:45\nThe JSON feed definitely changed in the last couple of days. It looks like the API gives me what I need though. –  Jon Skeet Mar 2 '11 at 12:52\nSorry, I wasn't really explicit enough (even after an edit, unfortunatly); I didn't mean that the JSON actually changed in September - it clearly didn't - mearly that it's status changed (to deprecated). ~ Hmmm, think I need a cuppa before trying to write anything else today... –  DMA57361 Mar 2 '11 at 12:58\nMaybe this should have been announced more aggressively, I maintain a small Android-Widget-App that displays a user's flair which now longer displays avatars or badges.. –  Josef Mar 3 '11 at 12:29\n\nYou must log in to answer this question.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

  "response": "### **Scene Concept: The Legacy Data Archive**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA sprawling, labyrinthine **legacy data archive facility**, once the heart of a now-defunct digital reputation tracking service. The facility is a relic of early internet infrastructure, filled with decaying servers, obsolete storage formats, and forgotten user data—some still valuable, some corrupted beyond recovery.  \n\nThe scene is inherently **multi-agent** due to:  \n- **Physical constraints:** Heavy server racks, sealed data vaults, and fragile storage mediums require coordination.  \n- **Information asymmetry:** Only some agents may have access to certain terminals or decode specific formats.  \n- **Time pressure:** The facility is scheduled for demolition, adding urgency to data recovery efforts.  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility consists of:  \n1. **Main Server Hall** – A cavernous room with towering server racks, flickering indicator lights, and thick bundles of cables underfoot.  \n2. **Legacy Terminal Room** – A dimly lit workspace with outdated computers, stacks of floppy disks, and a wall of CRT monitors.  \n3. **Secure Data Vault** – A reinforced chamber containing high-value user profiles, locked behind a defunct authentication system.  \n4. **Maintenance Closet** – Crowded with tools, spare parts, and a single humming backup generator.  \n5. **Archivist’s Office** – A cluttered desk with handwritten notes, printed logs, and a half-disassembled authentication dongle.  \n\n#### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n##### **Main Server Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **rack of 15 legacy servers**, each 2m tall, weighing ~300kg, with faded labels (e.g., \"USER_PROFILES_2005\"). Some emit a low, unhealthy hum.  \n- **Overhead cable trays**, sagging under decades of abandoned wiring.  \n- A **large emergency power switch** (locked behind a plexiglass cover).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **corrupt data tape drive** (model \"DDS-4\"), stuck in an error loop, requiring manual extraction.  \n- A **labeled master backup cartridge** (\"REP_TRACKER_FINAL\") in a locked drawer beneath a terminal.  \n- A **server with a flickering red LED** (indicating imminent drive failure).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **rolling tool cart** with screwdrivers, pliers, and a thermal sensor.  \n- A **dusty whiteboard** with a half-erased network diagram.  \n- A **functioning but ancient coffee machine**, its pot half-full of stale liquid.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Peeling \"DATA INTEGRITY POLICY\" posters** from 2003.  \n- A **broken office chair** with one wheel missing.  \n- A **stack of yellowed server manuals** in a corner.  \n\n##### **Legacy Terminal Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **wall-mounted CRT monitor array**, displaying fragmented user data.  \n- A **central terminal station** with a mechanical keyboard missing two keys.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **5.25\" floppy disk labeled \"FLAIR_JSON_LEGACY\"**, partially corrupted.  \n- A **USB-to-SCSI adapter** needed to access an external tape drive.  \n- A **handwritten note** (\"API migration docs in vault\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **dot-matrix printer** with a jammed paper feed.  \n- A **stool with uneven legs**, wobbling when used.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Stacks of unlabeled CDs** in spindles.  \n- A **dead potted cactus** on a filing cabinet.  \n\n##### **Secure Data Vault**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **biometric door lock** (fingerprint scanner, currently offline).  \n- **Floor-to-ceiling storage drawers** for archival tapes.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **locked safe** (requires a keycard from the Archivist’s Office).  \n- A **degraded tape labeled \"AVATAR_BACKUP_2009\"**, flaking at the edges.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **tape-cleaning station** with expired solution.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Outdated evacuation maps** from a previous owner.  \n\n#### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n##### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **Server Rack (300kg, 2m tall)** – Requires two agents to safely move without damaging adjacent equipment.  \n- **Emergency Power Switch (plexiglass cover, 4 bolts)** – One agent must hold the cover while another unscrews it.  \n\n##### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **external hard drives**, only one has a **blue \"CORRUPTED\" sticker**, a **scratched serial number**, and **unusual heat damage**—critical for diagnosing a data loss issue.  \n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The biometric vault lock is offline.  \n  - **Solution:** The **backup keycard** is hidden inside a **disassembled dongle** in the Archivist’s Office.  \n\nThis environment is **dense with interactive possibilities**, from **data recovery puzzles** to **physical coordination challenges**, ensuring rich multi-agent collaboration."
