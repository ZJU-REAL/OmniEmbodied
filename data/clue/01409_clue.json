At first Swype was working but today it only lets me press the keys and not drag my finger. I think I briefly saw a message saying \"dragging is not allowed in this mode\" but it went away fast. I've tried disabling and enabling and selecting Swype again but not good. How can I fix this?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 5 down vote accepted\n\nThis happens when you use Link2SD or Apps2SD and move either the Swype App or the Swype installer App to your SD card. To fix it, move the installer and Swype back to the phone and reboot.\n\nI found some of this information on http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1042241 the rest I figured out by trying things.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYou don't say anything about what phone or Android version you currently have. But Android 4.2 includes now a Swype-like gestual typing keyboard.\n\nThere is a downloadable version for you to install, if your phone supports it.\n\nTry out the new Android 4.2 keyboard now!\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nThis is most likely due to a licensing issue.\n\nYou should uninstall Swype and then use the Swype installer to install it again.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: \"The Android Device Repair Workshop\"**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling, slightly chaotic Android device repair workshop, where technicians collaborate to diagnose and fix a variety of malfunctioning smartphones. The scene is inherently multi-agent due to the need for coordinated troubleshooting—some devices require specialized tools, others need multiple hands to disassemble safely, and some repairs demand real-time communication between technicians to cross-reference solutions.  \n\nThe workshop is a mix of precision and improvisation, with workbenches cluttered with tools, half-dismantled devices, and scattered reference materials. The atmosphere is one of controlled urgency—some devices are marked as \"priority,\" while others sit in \"pending\" bins. The hum of soldering irons and the occasional frustrated mutter of a technician add to the lived-in feel.  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe workshop is divided into four key zones:  \n\n1. **Main Workbench Area** – The central hub with multiple repair stations, each equipped with magnifying lamps, soldering tools, and anti-static mats.  \n2. **Tool & Supply Wall** – A pegboard-lined wall with meticulously organized (but slightly overstuffed) tool racks and component drawers.  \n3. **Testing & Calibration Station** – A secondary desk with diagnostic rigs, USB multimeters, and a monitor displaying device logs.  \n4. **Storage & Incoming/Outgoing Area** – Shelving units holding labeled bins for \"new arrivals,\" \"awaiting parts,\" and \"completed repairs.\"  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Main Workbench Area**  \n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Anti-Static Workstations (x3)** – Each has a grounded mat, adjustable LED magnifying lamp, and small suction cup holders for delicate screen removal.  \n- **Shared Soldering Station** – A temperature-controlled soldering iron on a rotating arm, flanked by flux containers and brass sponge cleaners.  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Problem Device\" (Samsung Galaxy S23, disassembled)** – Screen detached, battery connector loose, motherboard exposed with a tiny capacitor visibly out of alignment.  \n- **Microscope on Articulating Arm** – For inspecting PCB damage, currently positioned over the malfunctioning device.  \n- **Tweezers with Non-Slip Grip** – Essential for realigning the capacitor.  \n- **Device Diagnostic Tablet** – Running a custom app that displays real-time voltage readings from the phone's test points.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Precision Screwdriver Set** – Magnetic tips arranged in a labeled foam holder.  \n- **Heat Gun (Idle, Temp Set to 180°C)** – For adhesive removal.  \n- **Small Suction Cup (Stuck to Workbench Edge)** – Used for lifting screens.  \n- **USB-C Cable (Frayed Sleeving, Functional)** – Plugged into a power meter.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee Stains on Workbench** – Dried rings from countless rushed breaks.  \n- **Handwritten Notes Taped to Wall** – \"REMEMBER: Check SD card slot for debris before reassembly!\"  \n- **Dead Pixel Test Image Open on a Forgotten Tablet** – Left running on loop.  \n- **A Pile of Discarded Screen Protectors** – Some still with fingerprints.  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Tool & Supply Wall**  \n#### **a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Pegboard Wall with Custom Hooks** – Holds everything from spudgers to thermal paste syringes.  \n- **Component Drawer Cabinet (Locked Wheels)** – Heavy-duty, with 30 small drawers labeled in shorthand (\"R10kΩ,\" \"USB-C Ports,\" \"OLED Flex Cables\").  \n\n#### **b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Locked Component Drawer (Requires Key from Workbench)** – Contains rare replacement parts.  \n- **BGA Rework Station (Powered Off, Safety Cover On)** – For advanced motherboard repairs.  \n- **Calibrated Torque Screwdriver (Hanging in Designated Spot)** – Required for iPhone repairs.  \n\n#### **c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Isopropyl Alcohol Dispenser (90% Full)** – Next to a stack of lint-free wipes.  \n- **Spare Battery Bin (Mixed Models, Some Swollen)** – With a \"CHECK VOLTAGE FIRST\" warning.  \n- **Label Maker (Low on Tape, Last Label Reads \"FRAGILE\")** – Slightly dusty.  \n\n#### **d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Employee of the Month\" Certificate (Faded, from 2018)** – Hung crookedly.  \n- **A Single Glove (Right Hand, Black Nitrile)** – Dangling from a hook.  \n- **Sticky Note with \"DON’T USE THIS SOLDERING IRON\"** – Taped to an old, burnt-looking iron.  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Testing & Calibration Station**  \n*(Continued in similar detail for remaining zones...)*  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **BGA Rework Station (150kg, Requires Two Technicians to Move)** – Bolted to a wheeled base but extremely unwieldy due to delicate internal components.  \n- **Component Drawer Cabinet (Locked Wheels, 3m Tall)** – Needs stabilization while accessing top drawers.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five identical-looking Samsung batteries in the \"Spare Battery Bin,\" only one has the correct voltage (4.35V) and a small green dot on the label. The others are mismatched or degraded.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The locked component drawer requires a key hidden inside a disassembled iPhone on the workbench. The iPhone itself needs a P2 pentalobe screwdriver, which is in the pegboard but obscured behind a hanging spool of solder.  \n\n---  \n\nThis dense, purposeful environment ensures that collaborative tasks emerge naturally—whether it's lifting heavy equipment, cross-referencing repair guides, or identifying the correct component among near-identical alternatives. The clutter and background objects force precise observation, while the embedded tool dependencies create multi-step problem-solving opportunities."
