Said victim of a baked theory usually thinks that the idea is complete genius at the time not seeing all the major flaws in their amazing revelation. The theory tends to come about in useless conversations had between fellow stoners\nSimon: I was getting stoned with Ross the other day and he reckons that tigers can't purr and lions can't roar...\nSonny: What!? That is such a baked theory has this kid never been to the zoo?\nby Sgurnz December 21, 2013\n\nFree Daily Email\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"The Stoned Inventor's Workshop\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA cluttered, eccentric inventor’s workshop where the genius (or madman) behind it all has been indulging in \"wacky backy,\" leading to a chaotic space filled with half-baked inventions, absurd prototypes, and dangerously improvised experiments. The scene is inherently collaborative because:  \n- **Heavy/Unwieldy Objects:** Many inventions are absurdly large or require multiple people to move.  \n- **Complex Tool Use:** The inventor’s intoxicated logic means solutions require piecing together bizarre clues.  \n- **Safety Hazards:** Multiple \"baked theories\" have led to dangerous setups that require teamwork to defuse.  \n\n#### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe workshop is a converted garage with the following zones:  \n- **Main Workbench Area:** The chaotic heart of operations—strewn with blueprints, tools, and half-finished contraptions.  \n- **\"Danger Corner\":** A cordoned-off section with jury-rigged electrical experiments and precariously stacked volatile chemicals.  \n- **Storage & Salvage Zone:** Overstuffed shelves of scavenged parts, labeled (poorly) in the inventor’s scrawl.  \n- **\"Chill Spot\":** A beanbag chair, snack wrappers, and an old record player—where the \"baked theories\" are born.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Main Workbench Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **steel-topped workbench (2m long, dented, stained with chemical burns)**, bolted to the floor but covered in clutter.  \n- A **wall-mounted pegboard** with missing tools and empty hooks, suggesting disorganization.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"The Purring Tiger Device\"** – A jury-rigged metal box with a speaker, labeled *\"Proof: Tigers Can Purr (See??)\"* in Sharpie. Wires are dangerously exposed.  \n- **Half-Disassembled Drone** – Missing a rotor, with a sticky note: *\"Lion ROAR module?? Test later.\"*  \n- **Locked Metal Cabinet** – Requires a key (misplaced in the \"chill spot\"). Inside: volatile chemicals.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **leaning tower of outdated tech manuals**, one bookmarked at *\"Big Cat Vocalizations (Outdated Edition)\"*.  \n- A **functional but flickering desk lamp** with a melted shade.  \n- A **mini-fridge** humming loudly, half-blocked by a stack of pizza boxes.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A framed photo** of the inventor grinning next to a zoo sign, with \"THEY LIE\" scrawled over it.  \n- **A potted cactus** (dead) used as a paperweight.  \n- **Dusty blueprints** for *\"Self-Watering Bong (Patent Pending)\"* pinned haphazardly to the wall.  \n\n---\n\n#### **B. \"Danger Corner\"**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **makeshift Faraday cage** cobbled together from chicken wire and duct tape. Inside: a humming, sparking device.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Lion Roar Simulator\"** – A car subwoofer hooked up to a car battery, labeled *\"Volume = Truth.\"*  \n- **Leaking Battery Acid** – A cracked jar with a note: *\"Do NOT mix w/ tiger purr juice.\"*  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **fire extinguisher (expired)** mounted crookedly on the wall.  \n- **Rubber gloves (one torn)** hanging from a nail.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **A \"DANGER: GENIUS AT WORK\"** sign, the \"DANGER\" part crossed out and replaced with *\"BRILLIANCE.\"*  \n- **A scorch mark** on the floor in the shape of a paw print.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **\"The Purring Tiger Device\"** (Weight: 80kg, Dimensions: 1.5m x 0.8m) – Too heavy for one person; requires two agents to lift safely around exposed wiring.  \n- **Leaking Battery Acid Jar** – Must be carried carefully by two agents (one to stabilize, one to guide) to avoid spills.  \n\n#### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **\"Tiger Purr Enhancer\" bottles**, only **one has a blue cap, handwritten \"DOUBLE STRENGTH,\" and a sticky note reading \"FOR SCIENCE.\"** However, a decorative **blue glass paperweight** nearby adds noise.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:** The **locked chemical cabinet** requires finding the **key (hidden under a pizza box in the \"chill spot\")**, but agents must also **avoid tripping over loose wires** on the way.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Note:**  \nThis scene is **overflowing with \"baked theories\" made physical**—each object tells a story of flawed genius, demanding collaboration to either complete or clean up the mess. The density of interactable and ambient objects ensures that agents must **navigate clutter, prioritize hazards, and think creatively** to succeed."
