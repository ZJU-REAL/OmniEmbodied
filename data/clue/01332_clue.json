  "response": "### **Scene Concept: \"Waaberi Music Collective Backstage (Circa 1985)\"**  \n\n#### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA bustling backstage area at the **National Theatre of Somalia**, moments before a **Waaberi musical performance**. This is a **high-stakes, multi-agent environment** where musicians, technicians, and stagehands must collaborate under tight deadlines to ensure a flawless show.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Time pressure & coordination:** Instruments need tuning, costumes require last-minute fixes, and stage props must be positioned.  \n- **Physical constraints:** Heavy equipment (e.g., amplifiers, drum kits) requires teamwork to move.  \n- **Specialized roles:** Musicians, sound engineers, and stage managers each have distinct tasks that must synchronize.  \n\nThe scene is **rich in sensory detail**—humming fluorescent lights, distant crowd murmurs, the faint smell of rosin and sweat—creating an immersive, high-energy atmosphere.  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe backstage area consists of **four interconnected zones**:  \n\n1. **Green Room (Artist Lounge)** – A cozy, slightly chaotic space with plush seating, vanity mirrors, and scattered personal items.  \n2. **Instrument Storage & Prep Area** – A semi-organized clutter of instrument cases, tuning stations, and repair tools.  \n3. **Stage Left (Wing Space)** – The final checkpoint before performers step out, filled with props, microphones, and emergency supplies.  \n4. **Tech Booth (Sound & Lighting Control)** – A cramped corner with mixing boards, monitors, and tangled cables.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Green Room (Artist Lounge)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **long, threadbare velvet couch** (one leg slightly wobbly, fabric faded in patches).  \n- A **dressing table with three lit vanity mirrors** (one bulb flickering intermittently).  \n- A **sturdy wooden wardrobe** (one door slightly ajar, hangers visible inside).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **handwritten setlist taped to the mirror** (one corner peeling off).  \n- A **leather-bound oud case** (left open, revealing the instrument inside—one string visibly loose).  \n- A **half-empty cup of spiced Somali tea** (still steaming, placed precariously near sheet music).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **portable electric kettle** (on, emitting a low hum).  \n- A **stack of folding chairs** (leaning against the wall, one slightly bent).  \n- A **small table fan** (oscillating but squeaking faintly).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Framed black-and-white photos** of past Waaberi performances (one slightly crooked).  \n- A **scarf draped over a chair** (bright red, embroidered with golden thread).  \n- A **cracked ashtray** (holding two cigarette butts).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Instrument Storage & Prep Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **large wooden instrument rack** (holding four guitars, two ouds, and a tambura).  \n- A **heavy-duty amplifier stack** (one speaker cone slightly dented).  \n- A **metal repair bench** (cluttered with screwdrivers, pliers, and spare strings).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **precious vintage Fender Stratocaster** (propped against the wall, missing a tuning peg).  \n- A **locked road case** (labeled \"PERCUSSION – FRAGILE,\" weighing ~80kg).  \n- A **partially disassembled microphone stand** (one bolt missing).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **tuner pedal** (powered on but displaying erratic readings).  \n- A **roll of duct tape** (half-used, sticky residue on the edges).  \n- A **portable stool** (one leg slightly shorter than the others).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old concert posters** (peeling at the corners).  \n- A **dusty metronome** (left at 120 BPM).  \n- A **forgotten fedora hat** (perched on a hook).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **C. Stage Left (Wing Space)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **heavy velvet curtain** (partially drawn, with a frayed hem).  \n- A **wheeled prop cart** (one wheel squeaky).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **malfunctioning spotlight** (overheating, emitting a faint burning smell).  \n- A **spare tambourine** (on a high shelf, slightly out of reach).  \n- A **fire extinguisher** (mounted on the wall, last inspection sticker faded).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **spare microphone** (wrapped in a cloth).  \n- A **set of stage weights** (stacked unevenly).  \n- A **clipboard with a checklist** (one item: \"CHECK SOUND LEVELS\" circled in red).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **single discarded glove** (lying near the curtain).  \n- A **chalk mark on the floor** (indicating performer positioning).  \n- A **half-empty water bottle** (condensation forming).  \n\n---  \n\n#### **D. Tech Booth (Sound & Lighting Control)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **large mixing console** (one channel fader sticking).  \n- A **rack of blinking LED lights** (one panel flickering).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- A **critical feedback loop** (audible in the headphones plugged into the board).  \n- A **loose XLR cable** (causing intermittent signal loss).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **spare pair of headphones** (left on the table).  \n- A **coffee stain on the manual** (open to \"Troubleshooting\").  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **post-it note** (\"CALL HASSAN ABOUT REPAIRS\").  \n- A **chewed pencil** (lying next to a notepad).  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The locked road case (80kg)** – Requires two people to lift safely.  \n- **The vintage amplifier (45kg, bulky shape)** – Needs coordinated maneuvering to avoid damaging nearby instruments.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n- **Attribute-based Reasoning:** Among five tambourines on the shelf, only **one has a red stripe and a small dent**—the lead singer’s preferred one.  \n- **Compound Problem-Solving:** The **loose oud string** can only be fixed using **the tuning peg stored in the locked road case**, which requires finding the **key hidden inside a drawer in the Green Room**.  \n\n#### **Atmospheric Noise & Distractors:**  \n- The **flickering vanity mirror bulb** could be mistaken for an electrical issue.  \n- The **scattered sheet music** might obscure the critical setlist.  \n\nThis **hyper-detailed, collaboration-rich environment** is primed for **multi-agent problem-solving, time-sensitive coordination, and layered reasoning tasks**."
