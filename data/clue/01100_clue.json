Six months after graduating I moved away to TN. Now my husband and I are moving back to ME in June. I have 1-2 yrs experience in med-surg, 4 yrs experience in ER, and 1-2 yrs experience with public health. I'm doing a little research in the nursing field in ME and wanted to hear from all of you. What do you feel are some strenghths for nurses in ME? What are some weaknesses? Any advice on where to work or where not to work? Any advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n    Thanks in advance,\n\n    Get the hottest topics every week!\n\n    Subscribe to our free Nursing Insights newsletter.\n\n  2. 1 Comments...\n\n  3. 0\n    Really anywhere you can get a job is good. CMMC is expanding their ER and hiring, though it appeared only PT jobs, as of last year. Don't know where you're looking, but as you know, there are only a few hospital choices for such a big state.\n\n\nA Big Thank You To Our Sponsors\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Emergency Department (ED) Expansion Zone – Mid-Construction**  \n\nThis scene is set in a bustling **hospital Emergency Department (ED) undergoing expansion**, capturing the transitional chaos of construction while maintaining critical medical operations. The environment is a **high-stakes blend of clinical precision and construction-site improvisation**, demanding **multi-agent coordination** across roles like nurses, doctors, construction workers, and logistics staff.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Heavy/Unwieldy Objects:** Medical equipment, construction materials, and temporary barriers require team lifting.  \n- **Time-Sensitive Coordination:** Medical emergencies and construction deadlines necessitate parallel workflows.  \n- **Information Scattering:** Critical documents (blueprints, patient charts) are dispersed across zones, requiring retrieval and synthesis.  \n\n---\n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n1. **Active Trauma Bay (Partially Relocated)** – A makeshift treatment area with **two curtained bays**, relocated due to construction. Equipment is **partially unpacked**, and some supplies are still in transit crates.  \n2. **Construction Zone (ER Expansion)** – A roped-off area with **exposed wiring, half-built walls**, and **pallets of drywall/flooring**. Heavy machinery (e.g., a **wheeled hydraulic lift**) blocks pathways.  \n3. **Nurses’ Station (Temporary Setup)** – A **repurposed admin desk** with **laptops on rolling carts**, paper charts stacked haphazardly, and a **whiteboard with scribbled shift notes**.  \n4. **Equipment Storage (Overflow)** – A **corridor lined with unopened crates** (labeled \"ER Expansion – Priority 1\"), **folded gurneys**, and **portable vital-signs monitors**.  \n5. **Break Room (Shared with Construction Crew)** – A tense coexistence: **a coffee maker with \"MED STAFF ONLY\" sticky notes**, **construction helmets on the table**, and a **broken microwave** beeping intermittently.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Active Trauma Bay**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Two mobile trauma beds** (hydraulic, 120kg each, one stuck in \"raised\" position).  \n- **Overhead surgical lamps** (one flickering; power cable snaked to an **extension cord** across the floor).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Unlabeled crash cart** (contents verified only by opening drawers; **one drawer jammed**).  \n- **Sealed biohazard bin** (overfull, **warning light blinking**; requires two people to lift).  \n- **IV pole** (wheel locked; **tangled tubing** in the base).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Portable vitals monitor** (displaying last patient’s **abnormal ECG**).  \n- **Rolling stool** (one wheel squeaks loudly).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Faded \"WASH HANDS\" poster** (peeling at corners).  \n- **Box of nitrile gloves** (partially crushed under a **fallen clipboard**).  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Construction Zone**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **Scaffolding tower** (3m tall, **missing a crossbrace**).  \n- **Pile of drywall sheets** (1.2m x 2.4m, **blocking a fire exit**).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Electrical panel** (locked; key held by **construction foreman**).  \n- **Sawhorse with circular saw** (blade **jammed**; **safety guard detached**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Hardhats** (three, one with a **cracked brim**).  \n- **Dust-covered blueprint** (taped to a beam; **critical dimensions smudged**).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Empty energy-drink cans** (strewn near a **coffee-stained floorplan**).  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Nurses’ Station (Temporary Setup)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations**  \n- **L-shaped desk** (one leg **propped up with textbooks**).  \n- **Wall-mounted whiteboard** (crowded with **erasable-marker notes** and **a single permanent-marker line**).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects**  \n- **Misplaced patient chart** (buried under **unprocessed lab reports**).  \n- **Medication lockbox** (combination **written on a sticky note stuck to a monitor**).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects**  \n- **Label maker** (out of tape).  \n- **Printer** (paper tray **jammed with a crumpled consent form**).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects**  \n- **Mug labeled \"WORLD’S BEST NURSE\"** (holding **chewed pens**).  \n\n---\n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Overfull biohazard bin** (weight: 25kg; requires two agents to lift without spilling).  \n- **Drywall sheets** (each 1.2m x 2.4m; cannot navigate corners alone).  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Five **medication vials** in the crash cart; only one has a **red cap**, **handwritten \"DILUTE FIRST\"**, and **half-empty volume**. A **nearby decorative red stress ball** adds perceptual noise.  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Jammed circular saw** requires locating the **detached safety guard** (under a **pile of insulation scraps**) and a **hex key** (in the **foreman’s toolbox**).  \n\n**Purposeful Ambience:** The **intermittent beeping** of the broken microwave forces agents to filter auditory distractions. The **smudged blueprint** adds realism—critical info is present but imperfect.  \n\n---  \nThis design ensures **emergent complexity**: agents must **navigate physical constraints**, **parse cluttered information**, and **leverage distributed tools**, all while **ignoring realistic but irrelevant \"noise.\"**"
