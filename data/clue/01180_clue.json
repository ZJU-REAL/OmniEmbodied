Associated Press\n\nManti Te'o did what pundits said he had to do in Tuesday's Notre Dame pro-day workout for NFL scouts: improve his 40-yard dash.\n\nTe'o did so with an official time of 4.69, more than a tenth of a second faster than he ran at the scouting combine last month. Twenty-six of the 32 NFL teams were on hand to witness the linebacker's improved time, but in the big picture, how important is it really?\n\n\"It's one part of it, but it's just one,\" Minnesota Vikings general manager Rick Spielman said after the workout. \"You'd rather see how he moves around in the other drills, really.\"\n\nThe only time Te'o might be asked to run 40 yards in a straight line in the NFL might be if he covers kickoffs on special teams, so more important are the quickness and positional drills. Scouts have questioned Te'o's lateral agility, tight hips and explosiveness, but Te'o was happy with how he did.\n\n\"I was very pleased with the way I performed,\" Te'o said, but suggested that the running portion of the workout likely won't affect where he's drafted in April. \"It's what you do on tape that matters most.\"\n\n—Eric Edholm\n\nWhere in the World Is Landon Donovan ?\n\nPresident Barack Obama jokes with LA Galaxy player Landon Donovan European Pressphoto Agency\n\nWhile the U.S. men's national soccer team toiled in Mexico City Tuesday in a World Cup qualifier, Landon Donovan, the team's all-time leading goal scorer, visited the White House in a ceremony honoring the L.A. Galaxy's 2012 Major League Soccer championship. The event was a coming-out party of sorts for Donovan, who has been on an extended leave from the game and the public eye since November. He is supposed to begin training with the Galaxy in the coming days and assuming he can return to form, could make it back to the national team for crucial matches in June, September and October.\n\n—Matthew Futterman\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: NFL Scouting Combine Training Facility**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA cutting-edge **NFL Scouting Combine Training Facility**, meticulously designed to evaluate and optimize athlete performance under high-pressure conditions. The facility is a blend of **high-tech sports science labs, agility training zones, and recovery areas**, all interconnected to simulate the rigorous demands of professional football scouting.  \n\nThis environment is inherently **multi-agent** due to:  \n- **Complex equipment setups** requiring multiple personnel to operate.  \n- **Athlete monitoring** involving real-time coordination between trainers, scouts, and medical staff.  \n- **Logistical challenges**, such as transporting heavy gear or adjusting testing stations for different drills.  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility is divided into **four key areas**, each with distinct purposes:  \n\n1. **Performance Testing Arena** – The main open-floor space with marked sprint lanes, agility cones, and digital timing systems.  \n2. **Biomechanics Lab** – A glass-walled room housing motion capture systems, force plates, and athlete monitoring stations.  \n3. **Recovery & Medical Bay** – A semi-private area with hydrotherapy tubs, massage tables, and diagnostic tools.  \n4. **Scouting & Analytics Hub** – A raised observation deck with multiple monitors streaming live performance data and video feeds.  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Performance Testing Arena**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **40-yard synthetic turf lane**, lined with embedded laser timing gates (accuracy: ±0.01s).  \n- Adjustable **agility ladder system**, mounted on rails for quick reconfiguration.  \n- A **portable blocking sled** (weight: 150kg) with force sensors in the pads.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Wireless sprint timers** (battery level: 72%, last calibrated 3 hours ago).  \n- A **stacked cone drill set** (12 bright orange cones, 3 missing their rubber bases).  \n- A **digital jump mat** (currently displaying an error code: \"CALIBRATION REQUIRED\").  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **hydration station** (half-empty Gatorade cooler, condensation pooling beneath).  \n- **Weighted resistance bands** (5kg, 10kg, 15kg variants) hanging on a rack.  \n- A **clipboard with athlete evaluation forms** (pen tucked behind ear of scout).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded motivational posters** (\"SPEED KILLS!\").  \n- **Dirty cleat marks** on the turf near the starting line.  \n- A **discarded protein bar wrapper** near the trash bin.  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Biomechanics Lab**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **3D motion capture rig** (12 high-speed cameras, one flickering).  \n- **Force plate treadmill** (max load: 200kg, currently idling).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **EMG sensor suit** (battery dead, charging cable tangled nearby).  \n- A **tablet displaying real-time gait analysis** (frozen on last athlete’s data).  \n- A **locked case of biometric electrodes** (key held by head technician).  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Adjustable-height tripods** for camera repositioning.  \n- **Spare calibration weights** (1kg, 5kg) in an open toolbox.  \n- A **whiteboard with scribbled athlete IDs** (eraser missing).  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Coffee stains** on a research paper titled \"Elite Acceleration Patterns.\"  \n- A **leaning stack of sports science journals**.  \n- A **dusty Newton’s cradle** on a shelf.  \n\n---  \n\n### **C.
