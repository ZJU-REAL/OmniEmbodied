My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\n\nThe remarks are remarkable since Mr Romney gives few interviews and is usually highly scripted. At one point, he joked that he'd have more chance of winning the election if his father had been born in Mexico. At another, he spoke of being born \"with a silver spoon\". In a third, he admitted that the campaign would use his wife Ann \"sparingly, so people don't tired of her\".\n\nAfter being shared on the left-leaning Mother Jones website, videos of the event rapidly went viral last night. Mr Romney's spokesman did not initially comment, but Obama's campaign pounced on them as further evidence of Mr Romney's elitism.\n\n\"It's shocking that a candidate for President of the United States would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the American people view themselves as 'victims,' entitled to handouts, and are unwilling to take 'personal responsibility' for their lives,\" they said. \"It's hard to serve as President for all Americans when you've disdainfully written off half the nation.\"\n\nIt was too early to say how the comments will effect voter sentiment. But the portion of Americans who do not pay income tax includes many elderly voters, most students, and the vast majority of the recently unemployed. They pay plenty of other taxes, and may now think twice about supporting a candidate who dubs them \"freeloaders\".\n\nThe snowballing scandal capped a day that had begun with Mr Romney insisting that there will be no changes to his inner circle, despite weeks of flat-lining poll numbers.\n\nStaff had promised a \"reboot\" of his campaign, which until now has focused on attacking Mr Obama. Beginning with a speech to Hispanic business leaders in Los Angeles, aides promised that he would outline specific policy objectives that would define his first term in office.\n\nBehind the scenes, that narrative was already muddied, however by talk of discord among his senior strategists. Late on Sunday, the Politico website published a gossip-filled expos√© of alleged disarray within the Romney camp, in which \"aides, advisers and friends\" blamed a senior aide, Stuart Stevens, for their recent loss of momentum.\n\nThe Politico piece had alleged that Stevens was responsible for making a series of late changes to Mr Romney's underwhelming speech to the Republican National Convention. He was also blamed for failing to vet Clint Eastwood's bizarre performance at the event, where the 82-year-old actor held a rambling conversation with an empty chair.\n\n\"As the mishaps have piled up, [Stuart] Stevens has taken the brunt of the blame for an unwieldy campaign structure that, as the joke goes among frustrated Republicans, badly needs a consultant from Bain & Co to straighten it out,\" it read.\n\nStuart Stevens: Romney's 'mad professor'\n\nWarm, approachable and slightly eccentric, Stuart Stevens presides over Mitt Romney's campaign with what friends and critics have described as a \"mad professor aura\". The 58-year-old has a colourful background, having skied to the North Pole and consulted on such Hollywood films as The Ides of March. Despite reportedly being Mr Romney's third choice as chief strategist, he has unprecedented responsibility, combining the role with that of chief ad-maker and chief speech-writer.\n\nGuy Adams\n\n\nLatest News\n\nLatest Sport\n\nLatest Showbiz\n",
  "response": "### **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** *High-Stakes Political Fundraiser Backroom*  \n**Core Concept:** A clandestine, high-dollar fundraising dinner held in a luxury hotel‚Äôs private function room, where political operatives, wealthy donors, and campaign staff navigate a delicate balance of strategy, secrecy, and optics. The room is designed for exclusivity‚Äîopulent yet discreet‚Äîbut hidden cameras and confidential documents make it a powder keg of potential leaks and PR disasters.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Collaborative Logistics:** Heavy objects (e.g., locked safes, AV equipment) require coordinated transport.  \n- **Information Control:** Documents must be retrieved/shredded, electronics secured.  \n- **Deception & Misdirection:** Staff must plant/remove items to manipulate perception (e.g., swapping donor lists, hiding recording devices).  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n**A. Grand Function Room (Main Stage)**  \n- **Purpose:** The \"show floor\" where Romney addresses donors.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Low chandelier lighting, burgundy carpets, a mahogany podium with the campaign logo. Feels both grandiose and hushed.  \n- **Key Features:** Raised dais, teleprompter, draped curtains hiding service doors.  \n\n**B. Donor VIP Lounge (Adjacent Private Room)**  \n- **Purpose:** Pre-dinner mingling; where sensitive conversations happen.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Leather chairs, cigar humidor, oil paintings of past presidents. A muted TV plays Fox News.  \n- **Key Features:** Locked liquor cabinet, a faux bookcase hiding a wall safe.  \n\n**C. Campaign Staff Workroom (Backstage Chaos)**  \n- **Purpose:** Nerve center for speech edits, damage control.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Flickering fluorescent lights, whiteboards scribbled with polling data, pizza boxes stacked near a wheezing printer.  \n- **Key Features:** Overcrowded with laptops, burner phones, and a shredder mid-use.  \n\n**D. Service Corridor (Staff-Only Access)**  \n- **Purpose:** Hidden transit route for staff/AV crew.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Concrete floors, exposed pipes, a mop bucket left mid-spill.  \n- **Key Features:** Freight elevator (out of order), janitorial closet with a broken lock.  \n\n**E. Restroom (Espionage Hotspot)**  \n- **Purpose:** Where staffers discreetly pass notes or make calls.  \n- **Atmosphere:** Marble sinks, gold fixtures, one flickering LED bulb.  \n- **Key Features:** A vent loose enough to stash a phone, graffiti (\"Stuart = ü§°\") etched near the paper towel dispenser.  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **A. Grand Function Room**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Podium:** Solid oak, 120kg, with a hidden compartment (empty, latch jammed).  \n- **Banquet Tables:** 10-seat, draped in black linen, centerpieces of wilting orchids.  \n- **AV Cart:** Wheeled, 80kg, with a projector displaying a frozen PowerPoint (\"TAX CUTS = JOBS\").  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Hidden Camera (Disguised as Smoke Detector):** Tiny red recording light obscured by dust.  \n- **\"Confidential\" Donor Binders:** Three copies, each with a missing page (pg. 47).  \n- **Teleprompter:** Frozen on the phrase \"*47% of Americans...*\" with a sticky note: \"DELETE THIS.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Portable Bar Cart:** Sticky from spilled bourbon, stocked with engraved glasses (one chipped).  \n- **Stage Monitor Speakers:** Emitting a faint hum, cables tangled.  \n\n**d. Background Objects:**  \n- **Framed Campaign Posters:** Slightly crooked, one with a coffee stain.  \n- **\"Reserved\" Place Cards:** Names smudged, one reads \"Mr. Freeloader\" in pencil.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **B. Donor VIP Lounge**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture:**  \n- **Wall Safe:** Behind a painting of George Washington, combo lock (last digit sticky from champagne).  \n- **Leather Chesterfield Sofa:** 200kg, one cushion concealing a dropped earring.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive Objects:**  \n- **Incriminating USB Drive:** Labeled \"BACKUP - DO NOT LEAK,\" tucked under a ashtray.  \n- **Donor Checks:** Stack of signed checks ($50k each), one with \"FOR TAX EVASION\" scribbled as memo.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Intercom System:** Crackling, set to mute.  \n- **Decanter of 30-Year Scotch:** Half-empty, cork missing.  \n\n**d.

Campaign Staff Workroom**  \n*(Follow same structure‚Äîexamples below)*  \n- **Anchor:** 8-person conference table, one leg propped with a binder titled \"FAILED REBOOT.\"  \n- **Key Interactive:** A redacted opposition research file, paperclipped to a photo of Obama.  \n- **Functional Ambient:** A wheezing shredder jammed with half-destroyed call logs.  \n- **Background:** A deflated \"BELIEVE IN AMERICA\" balloon tangled in the ceiling fan.  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n**Collaborative Transportation:**  \n- **Podium (120kg) + AV Cart (80kg):** Too heavy for one person; wheels jam if tilted incorrectly.  \n- **Wall Safe (150kg):** Requires two agents to slide the painting aside while a third dials the combo.  \n\n**Reasoning & Tool Use:**  \n- **Attribute-Based:** Among five USB drives on the staff desk, the critical one is the only one with a scratched label and a faint Sharpie mark (\"Stevens' Copy\").  \n- **Compound Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The shredder is jammed (paper overload + broken safety sensor).  \n  - **Solution:** A screwdriver (in the janitor‚Äôs closet) can pry open the shredder, but the closet is locked‚Äîkey is taped under the donor lounge sofa.  \n\n**Distractor Complexity:**  \n- **False Leads:** A \"leakworthy\" folder in the staff room is just catering receipts.  \n- **Sensory Noise:** The hum of the projector masks whispered conversations.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Note:** Every object‚Äôs state (sticky, jammed, half-empty) is a potential task trigger. The scene is a pressure cooker of physical and social collaboration‚Äîwhere moving a chair or hiding a check can change the narrative."
