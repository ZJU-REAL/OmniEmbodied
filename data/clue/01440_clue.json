You cannot provide IPv6 to other computers on your network with Teredo. Every node will have to do their own Teredo.\n\nBut Teredo is very unreliable. If you can use IPv6 provided by an ISP. If that is not possible then use a tunnelbroker like sixxs.net or tunnelbroker.net. Avoid unreliable methods like 6to4 and Teredo.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nCan I do NAT for IPv6 so all requests to Teredo will appear to be like if they oridinating from \"My Router\" instead? –  Vi.

You don't want that brokenness in your network... Set up a tunnel to SixXS.net or Tunnelbroker.net (both free) and you will be much happier. –  Sander Steffann Oct 2 '12 at 8:57\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n\n",
  "response": "### **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n\n**Scene Type:** *A Network Operations Center (NOC) for a small but critical research outpost, struggling with unreliable IPv6 connectivity.*  \n\n**Core Concept:** A high-stakes environment where technicians and engineers must collaboratively diagnose and repair faulty IPv6 tunneling configurations while maintaining essential services. The NOC is cluttered with aging and improvised equipment, reflecting a mix of legacy systems and experimental networking solutions. The unreliable Teredo tunnel forces real-time troubleshooting, requiring precise coordination between agents to reroute traffic, test connections, and swap hardware.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- Some tasks demand **physical collaboration** (e.g., lifting heavy server racks, rewiring patch panels).  \n- **Information asymmetry**—different agents have access to different tools or logs, requiring communication.  \n- **Time pressure**—critical systems failing means some tasks must be done in parallel.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \n\n1. **Main NOC Hub** – The central monitoring station with displays, a large server rack, and a diagnostic workstation.  \n2. **Network Closet** – A cramped, poorly ventilated side room with patch panels, switches, and a humming Teredo relay box.  \n3. **Supply & Repair Zone** – A cluttered storage area with spare routers, cables, and a soldering station for emergency fixes.  \n4. **Break Area (Distraction Zone)** – A small corner with a coffee machine, scattered manuals, and personal items—background noise that forces agents to filter relevant information.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n#### **1. Main NOC Hub**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **4U server rack (2m tall, 150kg)** with a half-racked legacy IPv4 firewall, a blinking IPv6 transition gateway, and a misaligned shelf holding a Teredo relay box.  \n- A **6-monitor dashboard workstation** with one flickering screen displaying a **real-time network topology map** (partially corrupted).  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Teredo Relay Box (30cm x 20cm, 8kg)** – Status LED flashing amber (unstable connection). A sticky note reads: \"DO NOT REBOOT – last fix attempt crashed tunnel.\"  \n- **IPv6 Test Terminal** – A keyboard with a missing `F5` key, running a continuous `ping6` command to a SixXS tunnel endpoint (currently timing out).  \n- **Emergency Procedure Binder** – Open to a dog-eared page: \"Teredo Fallback Steps.\"  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **label printer** out of tape, next to a half-used roll.  \n- A **KVM switch** with a sticky \"Port 3 = BROKEN\" warning.  \n- A **wheeled office chair** with a wobbly leg.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **\"World IPv6 Day 2012\" poster**, peeling at the corners.  \n- A **coffee-stained legal pad** with scribbled IP ranges and `traceroute6` attempts.  \n- A **dusty \"Employee of the Month\" plaque** from 2011.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Network Closet**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **floor-to-ceiling wire rack** sagging under the weight of tangled Cat6 cables.  \n- A **malfunctioning cooling fan** rattling at irregular intervals.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Primary Patch Panel** – Several loose connections; **Port #14 (labeled \"Teredo\")** is unplugged.  \n- **SixXS Tunnel Router** – Powered on but displaying **ERR: No heartbeat from broker**.  \n- **Spool of Fiber Optic Cable** – Unused, still in packaging but blocking access to the rack.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **cable tester** with depleted batteries.  \n- A **stack of zip ties** in a half-open drawer.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **faded \"LAN Party 2008\" flyer** taped to the wall.  \n- A **broken Ethernet jack** dangling by its wires.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Supply & Repair Zone**  \n\n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- A **metal workbench** with a **soldering iron (still warm)** and a **magnifying lamp**.  \n- A **heavy-duty storage cabinet (requires two agents to open, 50kg door)**.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Replacement Teredo Module** – In a **sealed anti-static bag (labeled \"TESTED – DO NOT USE UNTIL 2025\")**.  \n- **IPv6-Compatible Router (20kg, bulky)** – Still in original packaging but with a **handwritten note: \"Firmware needs update.\"**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- A **multimeter** with a cracked display.  \n- A **box of assorted screws** spilled on the floor.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- A **yellowed \"No Food Allowed\" sign** with a coffee cup stain.  \n- A **half-assembled Raspberry Pi cluster** gathering dust.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n#### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Server Rack (150kg, 2m tall)** – Requires two agents to safely reposition.  \n- **Storage Cabinet Door (50kg, stiff hinges)** – Needs one agent to hold while another retrieves equipment.  \n\n#### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:** Among five **chemical bottles in the supply zone**, only one has a **blue cap, handwritten \"CORROSIVE\" label, and is half-full**. A nearby **decorative blue glass paperweight** adds noise.  \n- **Compound Problem-Solving:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **Teredo Relay Box** is unstable.  \n  - **Solution:** The **replacement module** is locked in the cabinet, requiring retrieval of a **keycard** left in the NOC workstation drawer.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes on Atmosphere**  \n- **Auditory:** Hum of failing cooling fans, intermittent **error beeps** from the SixXS router.  \n- **Visual:** Flickering LED strips, a **wall clock stuck at 3:47 PM**.  \n- **Olfactory:** Burnt solder, stale coffee, faint ozone from overheating electronics.  \n\nThis dense, high-stakes environment is primed for **cooperative troubleshooting, real-time decision-making, and physical collaboration**—all while filtering through realistic distractions."
