I know all to well what you are talking about!! I \"was \" a patient out there, and I quit going 2 yrs ago. I didn't have insurance for one visit and they were charging me $191.00 for the office visit. As I manage to survive barely on my disability, I offered to pay $10.00 a month on the bill, but as luck would have it my other utilities went up at that time of the year which was winter so I couldn't pay the ten dollars to them. So on my next visit the gal that does the billing calls me out in the waiting room and literally chews me out in front of a room full of people!! I had a fall and broke my neck in 4 places I am lucky to be alive, I don't need that kind of treatment. The office staff at Columbia Pain Management, have no no manners what so ever. I have not been back there now for 2 yrs and I am not going to pay them.\n",
  "response": "# **Scene Concept: Overburdened Pain Management Clinic**  \n\n## **Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \nA **small, understaffed pain management clinic** where financial strain, administrative chaos, and high patient demand create a pressure-cooker environment. The clinic is **inherently collaborative** due to:  \n- **Overwhelming patient load** (requiring coordinated triage).  \n- **Complex medical & administrative workflows** (requiring synchronized staff actions).  \n- **Heavy/awkward equipment** (needing multiple agents for safe handling).  \n- **Hidden dependencies** (e.g., billing errors requiring cross-referencing records).  \n\nThe scene is designed to **simulate real-world medical bureaucracy**, embedding frustration points (lost files, malfunctioning equipment, overwhelmed staff) that demand **interdisciplinary problem-solving**.  \n\n---  \n\n## **Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe clinic consists of **four interconnected zones**, each with distinct functions and stressors:  \n\n1. **Cramped Waiting Area** – Overflowing with patients, mismatched chairs, outdated magazines, and a malfunctioning check-in kiosk.  \n2. **Understaffed Front Desk** – A chaotic hub with **disorganized paperwork, ringing phones, and a visibly stressed receptionist**.  \n3. **Examination Room (Primary)** – The main medical space with **aging equipment, a manually adjusted examination table, and a locked medication cabinet**.  \n4. **Back Office / Storage Closet** – A **cluttered, poorly lit room** containing **patient files, billing records, and medical supplies**—some expired, some misplaced.  \n\n---  \n\n## **Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **1. Cramped Waiting Area**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Reception kiosk (broken touchscreen, “Out of Order” sign taped over it).**  \n- **Overstuffed vinyl chairs (two with torn seams, one missing a leg).**  \n- **Wall-mounted TV (stuck on a news channel, volume too loud).**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Patient check-in clipboard (last updated 3 weeks ago, missing pages).**  \n- **Stack of outdated insurance forms (some with coffee stains).**  \n- **Wheelchair (one wheel squeaks, brakes partially functional).**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Vending machine (jammed, half the items stuck inside).**  \n- **Water cooler (empty, with a sticky note: “Out of Order – Use Break Room”).**  \n- **Wall clock (5 minutes slow, ticking loudly).**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded “Patient Rights” poster (peeling at the corners).**  \n- **Dusty plastic ferns (artificial, slightly yellowed).**  \n- **Chewed-up pens on a chain (attached to clipboard).**  \n\n---  \n\n### **2. Understaffed Front Desk**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **L-shaped desk (one side buried under unprocessed paperwork).**  \n- **Overloaded filing cabinet (drawer jammed, labeled “2020-2022 Billing”).**  \n- **Computer monitor (flickering, running outdated software).**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Unpaid bill folder (Gregory’s $191 invoice, marked “DELINQUENT”).**  \n- **Landline phone (constantly ringing, call log full of missed numbers).**  \n- **Paper shredder (jammed, half-destroyed documents spilling out).**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Coffee maker (burnt smell, empty carafe).**  \n- **Stapler (out of staples, jammed mechanism).**  \n- **Label maker (low battery, faint display).**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **“Employee of the Month” photo (from two years ago).**  \n- **Scattered paperclips and sticky notes (some illegible).**  \n- **Cheap motivational poster (“Teamwork Makes the Dream Work”).**  \n\n---  \n\n### **3. Examination Room (Primary)**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Hydraulic exam table (leaking fluid, stuck in “half-raised” position).**  \n- **Locked medication cabinet (digital keypad, low battery warning blinking).**  \n- **Wall-mounted X-ray viewer (flickering light, one hinge loose).**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Patient chart (misplaced, buried under unrelated files).**  \n- **Syringe kit (missing needle cap, biohazard risk).**  \n- **BP cuff (broken Velcro, inaccurate readings).**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Rolling stool (one wheel jammed, uneven).**  \n- **Sink (dripping faucet, low water pressure).**  \n- **Medical waste bin (overfull, lid not closing).**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Anatomy poster (slightly crooked, outdated).**  \n- **Dusty stethoscope (hanging on a hook, diaphragm cracked).**  \n- **Expired hand sanitizer (almost empty).**  \n\n---  \n\n### **4. Back Office / Storage Closet**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Metal shelving unit (overloaded, leaning slightly).**  \n- **Old fax machine (unplugged, paper tray stuck).**  \n- **Mini-fridge (humming loudly, interior light broken).**  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Misplaced patient files (scattered across desk).**  \n- **Box of expired medications (hidden behind newer stock).**  \n- **Spare keycard (for med cabinet, buried in drawer).**  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Printer (out of toner, error message flashing).**  \n- **Step stool (wobbly, one leg shorter than others).**  \n- **First-aid kit (partially used, missing gauze).**  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Old coffee stains on the carpet.**  \n- **Dusty holiday decorations (from last year).**  \n- **Broken desk lamp (cord frayed).**  \n\n---  \n\n## **Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances**  \n- **Leaking Exam Table (150kg, hydraulic failure)** → Requires **two agents** to stabilize while a third resets the mechanism.  \n- **Overloaded Filing Cabinet (jammed drawer, 50kg load)** → Needs **one agent to hold the frame steady** while another forcibly extracts stuck files.  \n\n### **Reasoning & Tool-Use Affordances**  \n- **Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n  - Among **five patient files**, only one has a **red “URGENT” sticker, coffee stain, and missing last page**—agents must cross-reference details to locate it.  \n  - The **expired meds** are visually identical to active stock except for a **tiny date stamp**—agents must inspect closely under poor lighting.  \n\n- **Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n  - **Problem:** The **locked med cabinet** has a dead keypad.  \n  - **Solution:** The **spare keycard** is buried in the back office, requiring:  \n    1. **Searching through cluttered drawers.**  \n    2. **Cross-referencing a misplaced memo about its location.**  \n    3. **Using the wobbly step stool to reach a high shelf.**  \n\n### **Purposeful Ambience as Distraction**  \n- The **flickering X-ray viewer** could be mistaken for a **monitor displaying test results**.  \n- The **“DELINQUENT” bill folder** is visually similar to other **pending invoices**, requiring careful reading.  \n\n---  \n\n## **Final Notes**  \nThis scene is **dense with affordances** for both **collaboration-heavy physical tasks** (lifting, stabilizing, transporting) and **complex reasoning challenges** (finding hidden items, diagnosing malfunctions, interpreting ambiguous records). The **chaotic, under-resourced setting** ensures that agents must **prioritize, communicate, and adapt**—mirroring real-world medical environments under strain."
