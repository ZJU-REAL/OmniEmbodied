Copper is almost never used for awards and has limited (but still some) value, thus it made sense for a starting point. Bronze, silver, and Gold are all awards and generally recognized in respective values so they were things to aim for if you started from copper, to work your way up to bronze, then silver, and ultimately gold. Finally platinum is generally recognized to be even more valuable then gold (and unlike copper-gold league its symbol had a picture on it instead of just bars making it unique) and thus was this extra supreme league for the best of the best to strive for.\n\nThe new system starts you in bronze by default, taking away the value of bronze as a reward, has gold in the middle which doesn't make much sense for what is generally considered \"the best\" award, then has both plat and diamond, two materials whose values in relation to each other aren't necessarily common knowledge. It may be because of my own ignorance but if you'd asked me prior to starcraft 2 which would be a higher prestige, to get a platinum award or a diamond award I'd have been unclear and probably have guessed platinum. Further, both plat and diamond have unique pictures for their league symbol, again adding ambiguity to which is better as well as just taking away from the \"special\" factor plat originally had.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not going to start a petition or anything to get it changed back, they can call the leagues whatever the heck they want, but I personally felt the original system with copper and no diamond was the superior one.\n#5BurnumMasterPosted 10/3/2010 5:49:51 AM\npretty sure its common knowledge that diamonds are more valuable than most anything\n",
  "response": "# **Starcraft League Ranking Archives - A Forgotten Esports Storage Facility**  \n\n## **1. Overall Scene Theme and Core Concept**  \n**Scene Type:** A dimly lit, cluttered storage facility housing the physical archives of an abandoned esports league ranking system. The space is a time capsule of competitive gaming history, filled with ranking trophies, player memorabilia, and outdated digital records.  \n\n**Why Multi-Agent?**  \n- **Large, Heavy Objects:** Oversized trophies, server racks, and locked filing cabinets require coordinated lifting.  \n- **Complex Retrieval Tasks:** Finding specific records involves navigating stacks of similar-looking items with subtle distinguishing features.  \n- **Environmental Hazards:** Exposed wiring, unstable shelving, and fragile relics demand careful maneuvering.  \n\n---  \n\n## **2. Spatial Layout and Area Descriptions**  \nThe facility consists of three interconnected zones:  \n\n1. **Trophy Hall** – A central chamber lined with glass cases holding ranking trophies (Copper, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond). Dusty pedestals display past champions.  \n2. **Data Archives** – A maze of filing cabinets, stacked document boxes, and decommissioned servers storing player records.  \n3. **Admin Office** – A cramped workspace with a computer terminal, printer, and disorganized paperwork. A whiteboard shows old league calculations.  \n\n---  \n\n## **3. Detailed Area-by-Area Inventory**  \n\n### **A. Trophy Hall**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Central Trophy Display (3m x 2m, glass panels, locked via keycard)** – Holds the rarest Diamond League trophies.  \n- **Freestanding Pedestals (1.5m tall, reinforced steel base, 80kg each)** – Designed to be moved only by multiple agents.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Copper to Diamond\" Plaque (30cm x 20cm, tarnished, engraved with \"Beta Era\")** – A disputed historical record.  \n- **Broken Glass Case (cracked pane, jagged edges, requires careful handling)** – Contains a missing Platinum trophy.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Digital Ranking Board (flickering LED display, stuck on \"Bronze\")** – Could be repaired with a spare fuse.  \n- **Trophy Polishing Kit (rusted metal polish, stained cloths, empty solvent bottle)** – Partially depleted.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Faded Esports Posters (\"2010 Championship Finals\")** – Peeling at the edges.  \n- **Dusty Helmet Display (cracked gaming headset, signed by \"DanTheTimid\")** – Non-functional memorabilia.  \n\n---  \n\n### **B. Data Archives**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Server Rack (2m tall, 200kg, humming faintly, one blinking red light)** – Contains decaying hard drives.  \n- **Metal Filing Cabinets (1.8m tall, drawers jammed in various states)** – Some require two agents to pry open.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **\"Copper League Records Box\" (cardboard, water-stained, marked \"Beta Only\")** – Contains disputed historical logs.  \n- **Locked Safe (digital keypad, requires a code from the Admin Office)** – Holds original league rulebooks.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Label Maker (low on tape, missing \"D\" and \"P\" letters)** – Can still print partial labels.  \n- **Microfilm Reader (dusty lens, requires cleaning)** – Displays old tournament brackets.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **Stack of Obsolete Magazines (\"Top 100 Players of 2010\")** – Pages yellowed with age.  \n- **Broken Coffee Mug (\"#1 Noodles Fan\")** – Used as a makeshift paperweight.  \n\n---  \n\n### **C. Admin Office**  \n**a. Anchor Furniture & Installations:**  \n- **Cluttered Desk (scratched surface, one wobbly leg)** – Covered in loose papers.  \n- **Outdated Computer (CRT monitor, Windows XP login screen)** – Takes 30 seconds to boot up.  \n\n**b. Key Interactive & Task-Relevant Objects:**  \n- **Safe Keycard (hidden under a keyboard, slightly bent)** – Unlocks the Trophy Hall case.  \n- **Whiteboard (erasable marker dried out, half-cleaned equations)** – Shows old ranking algorithms.  \n\n**c. Functional Ambient Objects:**  \n- **Printer (jam light blinking, out of cyan ink)** – Can still print in grayscale.  \n- **Stapler (missing half its staples)** – Barely functional.  \n\n**d. Background & Decorative Objects:**  \n- **\"Employee of the Month\" Photo (faded, frame cracked)** – Dated 2009.  \n- **Sticky Notes (peeling off, mostly illegible)** – One reads \"Fix Diamond > Plat debate.\"  \n\n---  \n\n## **4. Scene Affordances and Embedded Potential**  \n\n### **Collaborative Transportation Affordances:**  \n- **The Central Trophy Display (200kg, 3m x 2m)** – Requires at least two agents to move safely due to weight and size.  \n- **Server Rack (200kg, unstable if tilted)** – Agents must coordinate to prevent it from toppling.  \n\n### **Reasoning and Tool-Use Affordances:**  \n**1. Attribute-Based Reasoning:**  \n- Among **five nearly identical Copper League trophy replicas**, only **one** has:  \n  - A **scratched base** (from mishandling).  \n  - A **misprinted label** (\"Coper\" instead of \"Copper\").  \n  - A **hidden engraving** (\"Property of Killercuts3\").  \n- Background noise: **Decorative brass bookends** look similar at a glance.  \n\n**2. Compound (Tool-Use) Reasoning:**  \n- **Problem:** The **locked safe** in the Data Archives.  \n- **Solution:** The **bent keycard** hidden under the Admin Office keyboard.  \n- **Additional Challenge:** The keycard must be **straightened** using a **desk drawer ruler** before use.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Notes on Atmosphere:**  \n- **Ambient Sounds:** The faint hum of dying servers, occasional *drip* from a leaking pipe.  \n- **Lighting:** Flickering fluorescents, one broken bulb casting shadows over the trophies.  \n- **Implied Smells:** Dust, old paper, and a lingering hint of stale energy drinks.  \n\nThis environment is **ripe for complex multi-agent tasks**, from archival retrieval to delicate trophy restoration—each object designed with **purposeful interactivity** and **real-world logic**."
