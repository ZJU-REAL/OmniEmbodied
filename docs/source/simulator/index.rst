   overview

Overview
--------

OmniSimulator provides:

üåç **Rich Environments**
   Detailed room-based environments with realistic object interactions and spatial relationships.

üéØ **Action System** 
   Comprehensive action framework supporting movement, manipulation, observation, and communication.

ü§ñ **Agent Management**
   Multi-agent support with flexible agent architectures and coordination mechanisms.

‚úÖ **Task Verification**
   Built-in task completion verification with step-by-step progress tracking.

üîß **Extensible Design**
   Modular architecture allowing easy customization and extension of components.

Key Features
------------

Environment Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Room-based layouts** with realistic spatial constraints
- **Object persistence** and state tracking across interactions  
- **Dynamic discovery** system for progressive environment exploration
- **Multi-agent coordination** with shared and private observations

Action Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Basic actions**: Movement (go, approach), manipulation (take, place)
- **Observation actions**: Look, examine, inventory management
- **Communication actions**: Agent-to-agent messaging and coordination
- **Tool usage**: Specialized actions for different object types

Agent Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Flexible agent interfaces** supporting various AI architectures
- **State management** with configurable history and memory systems
- **Error handling** and graceful failure recovery
- **Performance monitoring** and detailed logging

Quick Start
-----------

Here's a minimal example of using OmniSimulator:

.. code-block:: python

   from OmniSimulator.core.engine import SimulationEngine
   from OmniSimulator.agent.agent import Agent

   # Initialize the simulation engine
   engine = SimulationEngine()

   # Load a scenario
   scenario_data = engine.load_scenario("00001")
   
   # Create and register an agent
   agent = Agent(agent_id="agent_1", agent_config=config)
   engine.register_agent(agent)

   # Run simulation
   results = engine.run_simulation(max_steps=100)

For more detailed examples, see :doc:`../examples/index`.

Configuration
-------------

OmniSimulator behavior is controlled through YAML configuration files:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # simulator_config.yaml
   simulator:
     global_observation: false
   
   task_verification:
     enabled: true
     mode: "step_by_step"
     return_subtask_status: true

See :doc:`configuration` for complete configuration options.
