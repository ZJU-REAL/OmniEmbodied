The baler machine requires repair, but no viable repair tool exists that meets the agent's constraints. The wrench_1 and pallet_jack_handle_1 both provide \"repair\" ability but are located in backroom_storage, which is only accessible through main_sorting_floor. However, the pallet_jack_1 (required to move heavy objects blocking access/path) is broken and cannot be repaired without its handle (pallet_jack_handle_1), creating a circular dependency. Additionally, the toolbox_1 (another repair tool) is in backroom_storage but requires opening first (no key/crowbar available in that room), and robots cannot carry objects exceeding their max_size [1,1,1] (e.g., toolbox_1 or baler components). Agent capabilities (max_weight=50, max_size constraints) prevent manipulating large machinery like the baler_machine_1 (size [2.5,1.8,2.0], weight 800kg).\n\nVERDICT: INVALID\n\nISSUES: \n1.
