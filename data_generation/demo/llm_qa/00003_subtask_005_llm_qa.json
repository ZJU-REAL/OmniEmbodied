Thought: The task requires fixing the only broken microphone in the main_control_room using the repair_kit_1. The agent needs to first locate the repair_kit_1 and then use it to fix the microphone. Since the current room is the equipment_storage_lounge, the agent should explore it to find the repair_kit_1.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Equipment Storage & Lounge and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The agent has explored the equipment_storage_lounge and discovered the repair_kit_1. The next step is to locate the broken microphone in the main_control_room and use the repair_kit_1 to fix it.\nAction: GOTO main_control_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Control Room\n3. Thought: The agent has moved to the main_control_room. The next step is to locate the broken microphone in the main_control_room and use the repair_kit_1 to fix it. Since the microphone is in the main_control_room, the agent should check if it is broken and then use the repair_kit_1 to fix it.\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must go to Equipment Storage & Lounge first to interact with Professional Repair Kit\n4. Thought: The agent needs to go to the Equipment Storage & Lounge to interact with the Professional Repair Kit. The current location is the Main Control Room, so the agent should move to the Equipment Storage & Lounge first.\nAction: GOTO equipment_storage_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Equipment Storage & Lounge\n5. Thought: The agent has moved to the Equipment Storage & Lounge and is now able to interact with the Professional Repair Kit. The next step is to use the repair_kit_1 to fix the broken microphone in the main_control_room.\nAction: USE repair_kit_1 ON microphone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: USE\n6. Thought: The agent needs to use the repair_kit_1 on the broken microphone in the main_control_room. The agent is currently in the equipment_storage_lounge, so the next step is to locate the broken microphone in the main_control_room and use the repair_kit_1 on it.\nAction: GRAB microphone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not exist: microphone_1\n7. 错误: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

Thought: The task requires fixing the only broken microphone in the main_control_room using the repair_kit_1. The agent needs to first locate the repair_kit_1 and then use it to fix the microphone. Since the current room is the equipment_storage_lounge, the agent should explore it to find the repair_kit_1.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Equipment Storage & Lounge and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The agent has explored the equipment_storage_lounge and discovered the repair_kit_1. The next step is to locate the broken microphone in the main_control_room and use the repair_kit_1 to fix it.\nAction: GOTO main_control_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Control Room\n3. Thought: The agent has moved to the main_control_room. The next step is to locate the broken microphone in the main_control_room and use the repair_kit_1 to fix it. Since the microphone is in the main_control_room, the agent should check if it is broken and then use the repair_kit_1 to fix it.\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must go to Equipment Storage & Lounge first to interact with Professional Repair Kit\n4. Thought: The agent needs to go to the Equipment Storage & Lounge to interact with the Professional Repair Kit. The current location is the Main Control Room, so the agent should move to the Equipment Storage & Lounge first.\nAction: GOTO equipment_storage_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Equipment Storage & Lounge\n5. Thought: The agent has moved to the Equipment Storage & Lounge and is now able to interact with the Professional Repair Kit. The next step is to use the repair_kit_1 to fix the broken microphone in the main_control_room.\nAction: USE repair_kit_1 ON microphone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: USE\n6. Thought: The agent needs to use the repair_kit_1 on the broken microphone in the main_control_room.
