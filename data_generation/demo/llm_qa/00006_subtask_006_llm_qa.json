Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects.

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found.

The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black).

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents.

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n13. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on was invalid. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which should be used directly on the held documents. Since the agent is currently holding the sensitive documents and is at the shredder's location, I need to use the shredder's functionality explicitly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but have not been shredded. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, but previous attempts to activate it via TURN_ON or PLACE...IN were unsuccessful. Since the shredder's properties don't support power operations (no is_on attribute) or internal placement, I need to directly utilize its shred capability while ensuring the documents are properly engaged with the device. The shredder likely requires the documents to be fed into its input slot, which corresponds to the \"on\" placement that succeeded earlier. Now I should activate the shredding function.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n13. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on was invalid. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which should be used directly on the held documents. Since the agent is currently holding the sensitive documents and is at the shredder's location, I need to use the shredder's functionality explicitly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n14. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but have not been shredded. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, but previous attempts to activate it via TURN_ON or PLACE...IN were unsuccessful. Since the shredder's properties don't support power operations (no is_on attribute) or internal placement, I need to directly utilize its shred capability while ensuring the documents are properly engaged with the device. The shredder likely requires the documents to be fed into its input slot, which corresponds to the \"on\" placement that succeeded earlier. Now I should activate the shredding function.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n13. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on was invalid. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which should be used directly on the held documents. Since the agent is currently holding the sensitive documents and is at the shredder's location, I need to use the shredder's functionality explicitly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n14. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but have not been shredded. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, but previous attempts to activate it via TURN_ON or PLACE...IN were unsuccessful. Since the shredder's properties don't support power operations (no is_on attribute) or internal placement, I need to directly utilize its shred capability while ensuring the documents are properly engaged with the device. The shredder likely requires the documents to be fed into its input slot, which corresponds to the \"on\" placement that succeeded earlier. Now I should activate the shredding function.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n15. Thought: The shredder does not support TURN_ON and previous PLACE actions haven't triggered shredding. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the documents are now on it, I need to directly utilize its shred functionality. The PLUG_IN action might enable the shredder if it requires power.\n\nAction: PLUG_IN document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support plug_in operation (missing is_plugged_in attribute)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n13. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on was invalid. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which should be used directly on the held documents. Since the agent is currently holding the sensitive documents and is at the shredder's location, I need to use the shredder's functionality explicitly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n14. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but have not been shredded. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, but previous attempts to activate it via TURN_ON or PLACE...IN were unsuccessful. Since the shredder's properties don't support power operations (no is_on attribute) or internal placement, I need to directly utilize its shred capability while ensuring the documents are properly engaged with the device. The shredder likely requires the documents to be fed into its input slot, which corresponds to the \"on\" placement that succeeded earlier. Now I should activate the shredding function.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n15. Thought: The shredder does not support TURN_ON and previous PLACE actions haven't triggered shredding. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the documents are now on it, I need to directly utilize its shred functionality. The PLUG_IN action might enable the shredder if it requires power.\n\nAction: PLUG_IN document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support plug_in operation (missing is_plugged_in attribute)\n16.

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n13. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on was invalid. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which should be used directly on the held documents. Since the agent is currently holding the sensitive documents and is at the shredder's location, I need to use the shredder's functionality explicitly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n14. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but have not been shredded. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, but previous attempts to activate it via TURN_ON or PLACE...IN were unsuccessful. Since the shredder's properties don't support power operations (no is_on attribute) or internal placement, I need to directly utilize its shred capability while ensuring the documents are properly engaged with the device. The shredder likely requires the documents to be fed into its input slot, which corresponds to the \"on\" placement that succeeded earlier. Now I should activate the shredding function.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n15. Thought: The shredder does not support TURN_ON and previous PLACE actions haven't triggered shredding. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the documents are now on it, I need to directly utilize its shred functionality. The PLUG_IN action might enable the shredder if it requires power.\n\nAction: PLUG_IN document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support plug_in operation (missing is_plugged_in attribute)\n16. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n17.

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n13. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on was invalid. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which should be used directly on the held documents. Since the agent is currently holding the sensitive documents and is at the shredder's location, I need to use the shredder's functionality explicitly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n14. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but have not been shredded. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, but previous attempts to activate it via TURN_ON or PLACE...IN were unsuccessful. Since the shredder's properties don't support power operations (no is_on attribute) or internal placement, I need to directly utilize its shred capability while ensuring the documents are properly engaged with the device. The shredder likely requires the documents to be fed into its input slot, which corresponds to the \"on\" placement that succeeded earlier. Now I should activate the shredding function.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n15. Thought: The shredder does not support TURN_ON and previous PLACE actions haven't triggered shredding. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the documents are now on it, I need to directly utilize its shred functionality. The PLUG_IN action might enable the shredder if it requires power.\n\nAction: PLUG_IN document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support plug_in operation (missing is_plugged_in attribute)\n16.

Thought: No objects have been discovered in the Data Vault yet, but the task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder. Since both agents are in the Data Vault and the room type (storage) suggests possible document storage, I should first explore this room to locate relevant objects like the collaboration table or shredder.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Data Vault and discovered 28 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the Data Vault, no collaboration table or black shredder was found. The task requires shredding documents on the collaboration table with a black shredder, which are likely in a workspace environment. The Engineering Hub (type: workspace) is the most probable location for these objects. I will move there to continue the search.\n\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n3. Thought: After moving to the Engineering Hub, I need to explore this workspace to locate the collaboration table and black shredder mentioned in the task, as they weren't found in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The sensitive documents are located on the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub, and the black shredder (document_shredder_1) is also in this room. I need to grab the documents first, then use the shredder to shred them.\n\nAction: GOTO collaboration_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaboration Table (in Engineering Hub)\n5. Thought: I am currently at the collaboration table in the Engineering Hub. The sensitive documents (sensitive_documents_1) are on this table and need to be shredded using the black shredder (document_shredder_1). First, I must grab the documents to carry them to the shredder.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n6. Thought: I am currently holding the sensitive documents and need to shred them using the document shredder (ID: document_shredder_1). The shredder is located in the Engineering Hub but not at my current location (collaboration table). I must first move to the shredder's location to use it.\n\nAction: GOTO document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Document Shredder (in Engineering Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the document_shredder_1 in the Engineering Hub, holding the sensitive_documents_1. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and matches the task description of a \"black shredder\" (brand: Fellowes, color: black). To complete the task, I need to shred the held documents using this shredder.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Target location Document Shredder does not support 'in' placement\n8. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to directly use the shredder on the documents I'm holding. Since there is no explicit SHRED action, I should try to activate the shredder's function by turning it on while holding the documents, as turning on the device might enable its shredding capability.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n9. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on is invalid as it lacks an on/off state. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the task requires shredding the documents, I need to use the shredder's functionality directly by interacting with it while holding the documents.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n10. Thought: The sensitive documents have been placed on the shredder, but the shredding action hasn't been triggered yet. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, so I need to activate its shredding function to complete the task. Since TURN_ON was previously invalid, I'll use the shredder's explicit ability by attempting to shred the documents directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 in document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n11. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but not shredded. Since direct placement \"in\" the shredder was invalid and TURN_ON is unsupported, I need to activate the shredder's \"shred\" ability while holding the documents. I must grab the documents again to use the shredder's functionality directly.\n\nAction: GRAB sensitive_documents_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Sensitive Documents\n12. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n13. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on was invalid. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which should be used directly on the held documents. Since the agent is currently holding the sensitive documents and is at the shredder's location, I need to use the shredder's functionality explicitly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sensitive Documents on Document Shredder\n14. Thought: The sensitive documents are currently placed on the shredder but have not been shredded. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, but previous attempts to activate it via TURN_ON or PLACE...IN were unsuccessful. Since the shredder's properties don't support power operations (no is_on attribute) or internal placement, I need to directly utilize its shred capability while ensuring the documents are properly engaged with the device. The shredder likely requires the documents to be fed into its input slot, which corresponds to the \"on\" placement that succeeded earlier. Now I should activate the shredding function.\n\nAction: TURN_ON document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support turn_on operation (missing is_on attribute)\n15. Thought: The shredder does not support TURN_ON and previous PLACE actions haven't triggered shredding. Since the shredder provides the \"shred\" ability and the documents are now on it, I need to directly utilize its shred functionality. The PLUG_IN action might enable the shredder if it requires power.\n\nAction: PLUG_IN document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support plug_in operation (missing is_plugged_in attribute)\n16. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n17. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n18. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n19. Thought: The shredder does not support placing items \"in\" it, and turning it on or plugging it in are invalid due to missing attributes. The shredder provides the \"shred\" ability, which likely requires direct interaction with the documents. Since the documents are currently placed on the shredder, I need to activate the shredding functionality by using the shredder's ability directly.\n\nAction: PLACE sensitive_documents_1 on document_shredder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: sensitive_documents_1\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
