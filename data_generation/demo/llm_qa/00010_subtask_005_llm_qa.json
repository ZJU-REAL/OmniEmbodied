Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to locate the torque wrench and chrome vanadium wrench set.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Mechanical Bay and discovered 17 new objects\n2. Thought: The torque wrench and chrome vanadium wrench set have been discovered in the tool cart. I need to go to the tool cart to access them.\nAction: GOTO tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tool Cart (in Mechanical Bay)\n3. Thought: I am now at the tool cart which contains both the torque wrench and the chrome vanadium wrench set. I need to grab the torque wrench first to use it on the wrench set.\nAction: GRAB torque_wrench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object torque_wrench_1 is in closed container Tool Cart\n4. Thought: The torque wrench is inside the closed tool cart. I need to open the tool cart first to access the torque wrench.\nAction: OPEN tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n5. Thought: The tool cart is now open, allowing access to the torque wrench. I need to grab the torque wrench to use it on the chrome vanadium wrench set.\nAction: GRAB torque_wrench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Torque Wrench\n6. Thought: I have the torque wrench in hand and need to loosen the chrome vanadium wrench set in the tool cart. After loosening it, I will place it on the workbench.\nAction: LOOSEN wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support loosen operation (missing is_loose attribute)\n7. Thought: The wrench set does not support the loosen operation. Since the task requires placing the wrench set on the workbench, I should grab it directly from the tool cart and place it on the workbench.\nAction: GRAB wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the torque wrench in hand and cannot grab the wrench set due to maximum grab limit. I need to place the torque wrench down first to free up my grasp capacity before grabbing the wrench set.\nAction: PLACE torque_wrench_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach workbench_1 before placing object\n9. Thought: I need to approach the workbench first to place the torque wrench down before I can grab the wrench set.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Steel Workbench (in Mechanical Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The torque wrench and chrome vanadium wrench set have been discovered in the tool cart. I need to go to the tool cart to access them.\nAction: GOTO tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tool Cart (in Mechanical Bay)\n3. Thought: I am now at the tool cart which contains both the torque wrench and the chrome vanadium wrench set. I need to grab the torque wrench first to use it on the wrench set.\nAction: GRAB torque_wrench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object torque_wrench_1 is in closed container Tool Cart\n4. Thought: The torque wrench is inside the closed tool cart. I need to open the tool cart first to access the torque wrench.\nAction: OPEN tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n5. Thought: The tool cart is now open, allowing access to the torque wrench. I need to grab the torque wrench to use it on the chrome vanadium wrench set.\nAction: GRAB torque_wrench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Torque Wrench\n6. Thought: I have the torque wrench in hand and need to loosen the chrome vanadium wrench set in the tool cart. After loosening it, I will place it on the workbench.\nAction: LOOSEN wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support loosen operation (missing is_loose attribute)\n7. Thought: The wrench set does not support the loosen operation. Since the task requires placing the wrench set on the workbench, I should grab it directly from the tool cart and place it on the workbench.\nAction: GRAB wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the torque wrench in hand and cannot grab the wrench set due to maximum grab limit. I need to place the torque wrench down first to free up my grasp capacity before grabbing the wrench set.\nAction: PLACE torque_wrench_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach workbench_1 before placing object\n9. Thought: I need to approach the workbench first to place the torque wrench down before I can grab the wrench set.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Steel Workbench (in Mechanical Bay)\n10. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can place the torque wrench down to free up my grasp capacity before grabbing the wrench set from the tool cart.\nAction: PLACE torque_wrench_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Torque Wrench on Steel Workbench\n11. Thought: Now that the torque wrench has been placed on the workbench, I need to return to the tool cart to grab the chrome vanadium wrench set.\nAction: GOTO tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tool Cart (in Mechanical Bay)\n12. Thought: I am now at the tool cart with an empty grasp capacity. I need to grab the chrome vanadium wrench set to place it on the workbench as per the task requirements.\nAction: GRAB wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Wrench Set\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to locate the torque wrench and chrome vanadium wrench set.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Mechanical Bay and discovered 17 new objects\n2. Thought: The torque wrench and chrome vanadium wrench set have been discovered in the tool cart. I need to go to the tool cart to access them.\nAction: GOTO tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tool Cart (in Mechanical Bay)\n3. Thought: I am now at the tool cart which contains both the torque wrench and the chrome vanadium wrench set. I need to grab the torque wrench first to use it on the wrench set.\nAction: GRAB torque_wrench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object torque_wrench_1 is in closed container Tool Cart\n4. Thought: The torque wrench is inside the closed tool cart. I need to open the tool cart first to access the torque wrench.\nAction: OPEN tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n5. Thought: The tool cart is now open, allowing access to the torque wrench. I need to grab the torque wrench to use it on the chrome vanadium wrench set.\nAction: GRAB torque_wrench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Torque Wrench\n6. Thought: I have the torque wrench in hand and need to loosen the chrome vanadium wrench set in the tool cart. After loosening it, I will place it on the workbench.\nAction: LOOSEN wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support loosen operation (missing is_loose attribute)\n7. Thought: The wrench set does not support the loosen operation. Since the task requires placing the wrench set on the workbench, I should grab it directly from the tool cart and place it on the workbench.\nAction: GRAB wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the torque wrench in hand and cannot grab the wrench set due to maximum grab limit. I need to place the torque wrench down first to free up my grasp capacity before grabbing the wrench set.\nAction: PLACE torque_wrench_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach workbench_1 before placing object\n9. Thought: I need to approach the workbench first to place the torque wrench down before I can grab the wrench set.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Steel Workbench (in Mechanical Bay)\n10. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can place the torque wrench down to free up my grasp capacity before grabbing the wrench set from the tool cart.\nAction: PLACE torque_wrench_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Torque Wrench on Steel Workbench\n11. Thought: Now that the torque wrench has been placed on the workbench, I need to return to the tool cart to grab the chrome vanadium wrench set.\nAction: GOTO tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tool Cart (in Mechanical Bay)\n12. Thought: I am now at the tool cart with an empty grasp capacity. I need to grab the chrome vanadium wrench set to place it on the workbench as per the task requirements.\nAction: GRAB wrench_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Wrench Set\n13. Thought: I have successfully grabbed the chrome vanadium wrench set from the tool cart.
