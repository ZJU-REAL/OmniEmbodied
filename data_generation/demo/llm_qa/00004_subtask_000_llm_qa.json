Thought: The calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station were not found in QA Testing Lab after exploration. Since Motion Capture Stage is an industrial room, it's the most probable remaining location for technical equipment like calibration tablets and charging stations. I need to move there to search.\n\nAction: GOTO motion_capture_stage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Motion Capture Stage\n7. Thought: The calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station haven't been found in previously explored rooms. Since I'm now in the Motion Capture Stage which hasn't been explored yet, I need to discover objects in this room to locate the required items.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Motion Capture Stage and discovered 11 new objects\n8. Thought: The calibration tablet (calibration_tablet_1) is located on top of the motion-capture rig in the Motion Capture Stage, and the wireless sensor charging station (wireless_sensor_charging_station_1) is also in this room. I need to first grab the tablet and then place it on the charging station.\n\nAction: GOTO calibration_tablet_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Calibration Tablet (in Motion Capture Stage)\n9. Thought: The agent is now near the calibration_tablet_1, which needs to be placed on wireless_sensor_charging_station_1. The next step is to pick up the tablet before moving it to the charging station.\n\nAction: GRAB calibration_tablet_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Calibration Tablet\n10. Thought: The agent has successfully grabbed the calibration_tablet_1 and is now holding it. The next step is to place it onto the wireless_sensor_charging_station_1, which is located in the same room (Motion Capture Stage). Since the agent is not currently near the charging station, I need to move to it first.\n\nAction: GOTO wireless_sensor_charging_station_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wireless Sensor Charging Station (in Motion Capture Stage)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Load: 0.0/10.0kg\n    - Grasp Capacity: 0/1 items\n  • Abilities: None\n  • Inventory: None\n\n▶ Agent: robot_2 (ID: agent_2)\n  • Location: Art & Animation Bullpen (ID: art_animation_bullpen)\n  • Physical Properties:\n    - Load: 0.0/10.0kg\n    - Grasp Capacity: 0/1 items\n  • Abilities: None\n  • Inventory: None\n\n\nTask: Place the calibration tablet with id 'calibration_tablet_1' onto the 'wireless_sensor_charging_station_1'.\n\nHistory: Recent Action History:\n1. Thought: No objects have been discovered in any room, including the current Art & Animation Bullpen. To locate the calibration tablet and charging station, I must first explore the current room to discover available objects.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Art & Animation Bullpen and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station are not found in the Art & Animation Bullpen. They must be located in one of the undiscovered rooms. Since the Server Room is a technical space, it's the most likely location for the charging station. I will move there to explore.\n\nAction: GOTO server_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Server Room\n3. Thought: I have moved to the Server Room, but no objects are discovered yet. I need to explore the Server Room to locate the calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Server Room and discovered 3 new objects\n4. Thought: The calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station were not found in the Server Room after exploration. Since QA Testing Lab is a technical room, it's the next most probable location for these items. I need to move there to search.\n\nAction: GOTO qa_testing_lab\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to QA Testing Lab\n5. Thought: The calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station haven't been found in previously explored rooms. Since I'm now in the QA Testing Lab which hasn't been explored yet, I need to discover objects in this room to locate the required items.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored QA Testing Lab and discovered 12 new objects\n6. Thought: The calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station were not found in QA Testing Lab after exploration. Since Motion Capture Stage is an industrial room, it's the most probable remaining location for technical equipment like calibration tablets and charging stations. I need to move there to search.\n\nAction: GOTO motion_capture_stage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Motion Capture Stage\n7. Thought: The calibration tablet and wireless sensor charging station haven't been found in previously explored rooms. Since I'm now in the Motion Capture Stage which hasn't been explored yet, I need to discover objects in this room to locate the required items.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Motion Capture Stage and discovered 11 new objects\n8. Thought: The calibration tablet (calibration_tablet_1) is located on top of the motion-capture rig in the Motion Capture Stage, and the wireless sensor charging station (wireless_sensor_charging_station_1) is also in this room. I need to first grab the tablet and then place it on the charging station.\n\nAction: GOTO calibration_tablet_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Calibration Tablet (in Motion Capture Stage)\n9. Thought: The agent is now near the calibration_tablet_1, which needs to be placed on wireless_sensor_charging_station_1. The next step is to pick up the tablet before moving it to the charging station.\n\nAction: GRAB calibration_tablet_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Calibration Tablet\n10. Thought: The agent has successfully grabbed the calibration_tablet_1 and is now holding it. The next step is to place it onto the wireless_sensor_charging_station_1, which is located in the same room (Motion Capture Stage). Since the agent is not currently near the charging station, I need to move to it first.\n\nAction: GOTO wireless_sensor_charging_station_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wireless Sensor Charging Station (in Motion Capture Stage)\n11. Thought: The agent is holding the calibration tablet and is now near the wireless sensor charging station. The next step is to place the tablet onto the charging station to complete the task.\nAction: PLACE calibration_tablet_1 on wireless_sensor_charging_station_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Calibration Tablet on Wireless Sensor Charging Station\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
