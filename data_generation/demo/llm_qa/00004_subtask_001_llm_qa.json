Thought: The framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) has been located in the Motion Capture Stage.

Thought: The previous GRAB action failed because the agent must approach the framed concept art before grabbing it. Since the framed concept art is located in the Motion Capture Stage and I'm currently in the same room, I need to move directly to the object first.\n\nAction: GOTO framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Framed Concept Art (in Motion Capture Stage)\n6. Thought: The agent is now near the framed_concept_art_1 in the Motion Capture Stage. Since the previous GRAB action failed due to proximity issues, but the agent has now successfully approached the object, it can be grabbed. After grabbing, the agent needs to transport it to the Art & Animation Bullpen where the target shelf (shelf_of_figurines_1) is located.\n\nAction: GRAB framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Framed Concept Art\n7.

I must first explore to locate these objects.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Art & Animation Bullpen and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) required for the task is not present in the Art & Animation Bullpen despite exploration. Since it must be located in another room, I need to search other rooms starting with the most likely location for concept art - the Motion Capture Stage (industrial/creative space).\n\nAction: GOTO motion_capture_stage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Motion Capture Stage\n3. Thought: The framed concept art 'framed_concept_art_1' hasn't been found in the Art & Animation Bullpen. Since I've moved to the Motion Capture Stage, I need to explore this room to locate the required framed concept art.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Motion Capture Stage and discovered 11 new objects\n4. Thought: The framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) has been located in the Motion Capture Stage. Since the target shelf (shelf_of_figurines_1) is in the Art & Animation Bullpen, I need to first grab the artwork here before moving it to the other room.\n\nAction: GRAB framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Framed Concept Art before grabbing\n5. Thought: The previous GRAB action failed because the agent must approach the framed concept art before grabbing it. Since the framed concept art is located in the Motion Capture Stage and I'm currently in the same room, I need to move directly to the object first.\n\nAction: GOTO framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Framed Concept Art (in Motion Capture Stage)\n6. Thought: The agent is now near the framed_concept_art_1 in the Motion Capture Stage. Since the previous GRAB action failed due to proximity issues, but the agent has now successfully approached the object, it can be grabbed. After grabbing, the agent needs to transport it to the Art & Animation Bullpen where the target shelf (shelf_of_figurines_1) is located.\n\nAction: GRAB framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Framed Concept Art\n7. Thought: The framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) has been successfully grabbed and is now in inventory. The target placement location (shelf_of_figurines_1) is in the Art & Animation Bullpen. Since I'm currently in the Motion Capture Stage, I need to move to the room containing the shelf first.\n\nAction: GOTO art_animation_bullpen\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Art & Animation Bullpen\n8. Thought: The agent is currently in the Art & Animation Bullpen holding framed_concept_art_1 and needs to place it on shelf_of_figurines_1. Since the shelf is in the same room but the agent isn't near it yet, I must first move to the shelf's location.\n\nAction: GOTO shelf_of_figurines_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Shelf of Figurines (in Art & Animation Bullpen)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing 'framed_concept_art_1' onto 'shelf_of_figurines_1', but no objects have been discovered in the current room (Art & Animation Bullpen). I must first explore to locate these objects.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Art & Animation Bullpen and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) required for the task is not present in the Art & Animation Bullpen despite exploration. Since it must be located in another room, I need to search other rooms starting with the most likely location for concept art - the Motion Capture Stage (industrial/creative space).\n\nAction: GOTO motion_capture_stage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Motion Capture Stage\n3. Thought: The framed concept art 'framed_concept_art_1' hasn't been found in the Art & Animation Bullpen. Since I've moved to the Motion Capture Stage, I need to explore this room to locate the required framed concept art.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Motion Capture Stage and discovered 11 new objects\n4. Thought: The framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) has been located in the Motion Capture Stage. Since the target shelf (shelf_of_figurines_1) is in the Art & Animation Bullpen, I need to first grab the artwork here before moving it to the other room.\n\nAction: GRAB framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Framed Concept Art before grabbing\n5. Thought: The previous GRAB action failed because the agent must approach the framed concept art before grabbing it. Since the framed concept art is located in the Motion Capture Stage and I'm currently in the same room, I need to move directly to the object first.\n\nAction: GOTO framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Framed Concept Art (in Motion Capture Stage)\n6. Thought: The agent is now near the framed_concept_art_1 in the Motion Capture Stage. Since the previous GRAB action failed due to proximity issues, but the agent has now successfully approached the object, it can be grabbed. After grabbing, the agent needs to transport it to the Art & Animation Bullpen where the target shelf (shelf_of_figurines_1) is located.\n\nAction: GRAB framed_concept_art_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Framed Concept Art\n7. Thought: The framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) has been successfully grabbed and is now in inventory. The target placement location (shelf_of_figurines_1) is in the Art & Animation Bullpen. Since I'm currently in the Motion Capture Stage, I need to move to the room containing the shelf first.\n\nAction: GOTO art_animation_bullpen\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Art & Animation Bullpen\n8. Thought: The agent is currently in the Art & Animation Bullpen holding framed_concept_art_1 and needs to place it on shelf_of_figurines_1. Since the shelf is in the same room but the agent isn't near it yet, I must first move to the shelf's location.\n\nAction: GOTO shelf_of_figurines_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Shelf of Figurines (in Art & Animation Bullpen)\n9. Thought: The agent is holding the framed_concept_art_1 and has successfully approached the target shelf (shelf_of_figurines_1) in the Art & Animation Bullpen. The next logical step is to place the framed concept art onto the shelf to complete the task.\n\nAction: PLACE framed_concept_art_1 on shelf_of_figurines_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Framed Concept Art on Shelf of Figurines\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The task was to place the framed concept art (framed_concept_art_1) onto the shelf (shelf_of_figurines_1). The action history shows that the agent successfully grabbed the artwork from the Motion Capture Stage, transported it to the Art & Animation Bullpen, approached the shelf, and placed the artwork on it (ActionStatus.SUCCESS in step 9). Since the task objective has been fully completed, no further actions are required.\n\nAction: DONE",
