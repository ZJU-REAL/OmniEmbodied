Thought: The agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, but the task requires finding an object on the steel workbench, which is likely in the Main Workbench Area. Since no objects are discovered in any room, I need to first move to the Main Workbench Area to explore and find the target object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n2. Thought: The agent has successfully moved to the Main Workbench Area, but no objects are discovered yet. To find the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench, I must first explore this room to identify available objects and locate the steel workbench.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n3. Thought: The calibration jig (ID: calibration_jig_1) is the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench at 8.0kg, made of aluminum. I need to grab it and place it in the storage room. First, I must move to the steel workbench to access the object.\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n4. Thought: The calibration jig (ID: calibration_jig_1) has been identified as the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench at 8.0kg, made of aluminum. Since the agent is currently at the steel_workbench_1 location, the next step is to grab this object to prepare for transport to the storage room.\n\nAction: GRAB calibration_jig_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Calibration Jig\n5. Thought: The agent has successfully grabbed the calibration_jig_1 (heaviest metal object on the steel workbench). Now it needs to be placed in the Storage & Component Shelves room. Since the agent is currently in the Main Workbench Area, it must first move to the storage room.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n6. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, holding the calibration_jig_1 (the heaviest metal object from the steel workbench). Since the task requires placing it in this storage room, I need to identify a suitable surface or container here. No objects are currently discovered in this room, so exploration is necessary to find placement targets.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

The Heavy-Duty Shelving Unit (ID: heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1) is a suitable storage surface in this room, as it's designed to hold heavy objects and already contains storage bins and components. Since the agent is in the same room as the shelving unit but not yet at its exact location, moving to it is necessary before placement.\n\nAction: GOTO heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1",

Thought: The agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, but the task requires finding an object on the steel workbench, which is likely in the Main Workbench Area. Since no objects are discovered in any room, I need to first move to the Main Workbench Area to explore and find the target object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n2. Thought: The agent has successfully moved to the Main Workbench Area, but no objects are discovered yet. To find the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench, I must first explore this room to identify available objects and locate the steel workbench.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n3. Thought: The calibration jig (ID: calibration_jig_1) is the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench at 8.0kg, made of aluminum. I need to grab it and place it in the storage room. First, I must move to the steel workbench to access the object.\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n4. Thought: The calibration jig (ID: calibration_jig_1) has been identified as the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench at 8.0kg, made of aluminum. Since the agent is currently at the steel_workbench_1 location, the next step is to grab this object to prepare for transport to the storage room.\n\nAction: GRAB calibration_jig_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Calibration Jig\n5. Thought: The agent has successfully grabbed the calibration_jig_1 (heaviest metal object on the steel workbench). Now it needs to be placed in the Storage & Component Shelves room. Since the agent is currently in the Main Workbench Area, it must first move to the storage room.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n6. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, holding the calibration_jig_1 (the heaviest metal object from the steel workbench). Since the task requires placing it in this storage room, I need to identify a suitable surface or container here. No objects are currently discovered in this room, so exploration is necessary to find placement targets.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n7. Thought: The agent is holding the calibration_jig_1 and is in the Storage & Component Shelves room. The task requires placing this heaviest metal object in this storage room. The Heavy-Duty Shelving Unit (ID: heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1) is a suitable storage surface in this room, as it's designed to hold heavy objects and already contains storage bins and components. Since the agent is in the same room as the shelving unit but not yet at its exact location, moving to it is necessary before placement.\n\nAction: GOTO heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Heavy-Duty Shelving Unit (in Storage & Component Shelves)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, but the task requires finding an object on the steel workbench, which is likely in the Main Workbench Area. Since no objects are discovered in any room, I need to first move to the Main Workbench Area to explore and find the target object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n2. Thought: The agent has successfully moved to the Main Workbench Area, but no objects are discovered yet. To find the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench, I must first explore this room to identify available objects and locate the steel workbench.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n3. Thought: The calibration jig (ID: calibration_jig_1) is the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench at 8.0kg, made of aluminum. I need to grab it and place it in the storage room. First, I must move to the steel workbench to access the object.\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n4. Thought: The calibration jig (ID: calibration_jig_1) has been identified as the heaviest metal object on the steel workbench at 8.0kg, made of aluminum. Since the agent is currently at the steel_workbench_1 location, the next step is to grab this object to prepare for transport to the storage room.\n\nAction: GRAB calibration_jig_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Calibration Jig\n5. Thought: The agent has successfully grabbed the calibration_jig_1 (heaviest metal object on the steel workbench). Now it needs to be placed in the Storage & Component Shelves room. Since the agent is currently in the Main Workbench Area, it must first move to the storage room.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n6. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, holding the calibration_jig_1 (the heaviest metal object from the steel workbench). Since the task requires placing it in this storage room, I need to identify a suitable surface or container here. No objects are currently discovered in this room, so exploration is necessary to find placement targets.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n7. Thought: The agent is holding the calibration_jig_1 and is in the Storage & Component Shelves room. The task requires placing this heaviest metal object in this storage room. The Heavy-Duty Shelving Unit (ID: heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1) is a suitable storage surface in this room, as it's designed to hold heavy objects and already contains storage bins and components. Since the agent is in the same room as the shelving unit but not yet at its exact location, moving to it is necessary before placement.\n\nAction: GOTO heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Heavy-Duty Shelving Unit (in Storage & Component Shelves)\n8. Thought: The agent is holding the calibration_jig_1 and is now positioned at the heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1 in the Storage & Component Shelves room. Since the task requires placing the heaviest metal object (calibration_jig_1) in this storage room, and the heavy-duty shelving unit is an appropriate storage surface, the next step is to place the object onto it.\n\nAction: PLACE calibration_jig_1 on heavy_duty_shelving_unit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Calibration Jig on Heavy-Duty Shelving Unit\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
