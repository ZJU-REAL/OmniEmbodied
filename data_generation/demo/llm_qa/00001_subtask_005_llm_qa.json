Thought: The soldering iron station is not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station) as it wasn't discovered during exploration. I need to check the next likely room which would be the Main Workbench Area.\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n3. Thought: The soldering iron station was not found in the Filter Simulation Station, and I've now moved to the Main Workbench Area. Since no objects have been discovered here yet, I need to explore this room to find the blinking soldering iron station on the steel workbench.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n4. Thought: The soldering iron station has been discovered in the Main Workbench Area and is currently on and blinking. The task requires turning it off.\nAction: TURN_OFF soldering_iron_station_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed turn_off on Soldering Iron Station, is_on changed from True to False\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
