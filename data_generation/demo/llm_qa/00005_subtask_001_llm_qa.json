The next step is to go to the master_control_console_1 to place the award on it.\nAction: GOTO master_control_console_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Master Control Console (in Main Command Hub)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. I need to explore the current room (break_room_archive_nook) first to locate city_award_1 or master_control_console_1, or find clues about their locations.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room & Archive Nook and discovered 15 new objects\n2. Thought: The required objects \"city_award_1\" and \"master_control_console_1\" are not present in the current Break Room & Archive Nook. Since the previous exploration only covered this room, I need to search other rooms. The Main Command Hub (type: command_center) is the most likely location for a master control console, so I'll go there next to explore.\n\nAction: GOTO main_command_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Command Hub\n3. Thought: The master_control_console_1 is likely in the Main Command Hub given its command_center room type, but no objects have been discovered here yet. I need to explore this room to locate both the city_award_1 and master_control_console_1.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Command Hub and discovered 11 new objects\n4. Thought: The city_award_1 is located on the bulletin_board_wall_1 in the current room, and the master_control_console_1 is also present here. I need to first go to the bulletin board to access the award.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_wall_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Steel-Frame Bulletin Board Wall (in Main Command Hub)\n5. Thought: The city_award_1 is on the bulletin_board_wall_1 where I'm currently located. I need to grab it first before moving to the master_control_console_1 for placement.\nAction: GRAB city_award_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Framed 'City of the Year 2040' Award\n6. Thought: I have successfully grabbed the city_award_1 and am currently at the bulletin_board_wall_1. The next step is to go to the master_control_console_1 to place the award on it.\nAction: GOTO master_control_console_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Master Control Console (in Main Command Hub)\n7. Thought: I am currently at the master_control_console_1 in the Main Command Hub, holding the city_award_1. The task requires placing the award on the master control console, so I should directly execute the placement action.\n\nAction: PLACE city_award_1 on master_control_console_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Framed 'City of the Year 2040' Award on Master Control Console\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
