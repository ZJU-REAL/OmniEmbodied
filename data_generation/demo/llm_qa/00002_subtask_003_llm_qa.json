I need to explore the break_room first to identify available objects and their properties.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the break_room, I've identified all objects. The heaviest portable item (within my 10kg carrying capacity) is the bulletin_board_1 at 8.0kg. I need to move to it first before grabbing.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bulletin Board (in Break Room)\n3. Thought: After successfully moving to the bulletin_board_1, the next step is to grab it since it's the heaviest portable object (8.0kg) within the agent's 10kg carrying capacity. Once grabbed, I'll need to move it to the main_newsroom.\nAction: GRAB bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 物体长度1.2m超过智能体最大限制1.0m\n4. Thought: The bulletin board is too long (1.2m) to be grabbed, so it cannot be moved. The next heaviest portable item in the break_room is the garden rake (rake_1) weighing 1.5kg, which is within the agent's carrying capacity and size constraints. I need to move to the rake first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO rake_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Garden Rake (in Break Room)\n5. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n6. Thought: The previous GRAB attempt on bulletin_board_1 failed due to size constraints (1.2m > 1.0m max). The next heaviest portable object in break_room is rake_1 (1.5kg), which is within both weight (10kg max) and size constraints. Since I'm already at rake_1 (GOTO successful), I should now grab it to prepare for transportation.\n\nAction: GRAB rake_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Garden Rake\n7. Thought: The heaviest portable item in the break_room that can be carried (within 10kg weight limit and 1m size constraint) is the rake_1 (1.5kg), which is already grabbed and held. Now I need to transport it to the main_newsroom. Since no objects are known in the main_newsroom yet, I must first move there using GOTO.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n8. Thought: The agent is currently in the main_newsroom holding the heaviest portable item (rake_1) from the break_room. To complete the task of placing it in the main_newsroom, I need to identify a valid surface or container in this room. Since no objects are currently discovered in the main_newsroom, I must explore the room first to find a suitable placement target.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n9. Thought: The heaviest portable item from the break_room (rake_1) is already held. Now in main_newsroom, I need to place it on a suitable surface. The Collaborative Worktable (worktable_1) is a valid target for placement.\n\nAction: GOTO worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaborative Worktable (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to find the heaviest item in the break_room and place it in the main_newsroom. Currently, no objects are discovered in the break_room. I need to explore the break_room first to identify available objects and their properties.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: After exploring the break_room, I've identified all objects. The heaviest portable item (within my 10kg carrying capacity) is the bulletin_board_1 at 8.0kg. I need to move to it first before grabbing.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bulletin Board (in Break Room)\n3. Thought: After successfully moving to the bulletin_board_1, the next step is to grab it since it's the heaviest portable object (8.0kg) within the agent's 10kg carrying capacity. Once grabbed, I'll need to move it to the main_newsroom.\nAction: GRAB bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 物体长度1.2m超过智能体最大限制1.0m\n4. Thought: The bulletin board is too long (1.2m) to be grabbed, so it cannot be moved. The next heaviest portable item in the break_room is the garden rake (rake_1) weighing 1.5kg, which is within the agent's carrying capacity and size constraints. I need to move to the rake first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO rake_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Garden Rake (in Break Room)\n5. Action: , Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE, Message: 处理命令出错: list index out of range\n6. Thought: The previous GRAB attempt on bulletin_board_1 failed due to size constraints (1.2m > 1.0m max). The next heaviest portable object in break_room is rake_1 (1.5kg), which is within both weight (10kg max) and size constraints. Since I'm already at rake_1 (GOTO successful), I should now grab it to prepare for transportation.\n\nAction: GRAB rake_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Garden Rake\n7. Thought: The heaviest portable item in the break_room that can be carried (within 10kg weight limit and 1m size constraint) is the rake_1 (1.5kg), which is already grabbed and held. Now I need to transport it to the main_newsroom. Since no objects are known in the main_newsroom yet, I must first move there using GOTO.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n8. Thought: The agent is currently in the main_newsroom holding the heaviest portable item (rake_1) from the break_room. To complete the task of placing it in the main_newsroom, I need to identify a valid surface or container in this room. Since no objects are currently discovered in the main_newsroom, I must explore the room first to find a suitable placement target.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n9. Thought: The heaviest portable item from the break_room (rake_1) is already held. Now in main_newsroom, I need to place it on a suitable surface. The Collaborative Worktable (worktable_1) is a valid target for placement.\n\nAction: GOTO worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaborative Worktable (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n10. Thought: The agent is holding the rake_1 (heaviest portable item from break_room) and is currently positioned at worktable_1 in main_newsroom. The task requires placing this item in the main_newsroom, and placing it on the worktable satisfies this requirement. The PLACE action can be executed since the agent is at the target location and holding the object.\n\nAction: PLACE rake_1 on worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Garden Rake on Collaborative Worktable\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
