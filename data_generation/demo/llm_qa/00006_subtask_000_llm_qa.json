I need to search other objects in the Data Vault to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO backup_tape_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Backup Tape (in Data Vault)\n15. Thought: The Backup Tape is in the Data Vault, but it does not contain the thermal_scanner_1 or collaboration_table_1. I need to search other objects in the Data Vault to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO backup_tape_2\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Backup Tape (in Data Vault)\n16. Thought: The current room (Data Vault) has been explored, but the thermal_scanner_1 and collaboration_table_1 have not been located. I need to continue searching for these objects in the Data Vault.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Data Vault but found no new objects\n17. Thought: The thermal_scanner_1 and collaboration_table_1 are not found in the Data Vault. I need to check other rooms or confirm if these objects are present in the environment.\nAction: GOTO server_farm\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Server Farm\n18. Thought: The thermal_scanner_1 and collaboration_table_1 are not found in the Data Vault or Server Farm. I need to check other rooms or confirm if these objects are present in the environment.\nAction: GOTO engineering_hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Engineering Hub\n19. Thought: The thermal_scanner_1 and collaboration_table_1 have not been found in the explored rooms. I need to check if these objects are present in the environment or if they are in a different location that has not been explored yet.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Engineering Hub and discovered 18 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
