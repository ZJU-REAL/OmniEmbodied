I need to explore the current room (intake_bay) first to find the yellow, large rubber boot and the sorting_table_1.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Intake Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n2. Thought: The yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is currently inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). I need to first open the box to access the boot.\nAction: OPEN gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Empty Gaylord Box, is_open changed from False to True\n3. Thought: The yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is now accessible inside the opened Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). I need to grab the boot to move it to the sorting_table_1.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Single Rubber Boot before grabbing\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the opened Gaylord Box but I need to approach it before grabbing. I should go to the Gaylord Box first.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n5. Thought: Now that I'm near the Empty Gaylord Box, I can grab the yellow rubber boot inside it.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Single Rubber Boot\n6. Thought: The yellow rubber boot is now in my inventory. I need to find the sorting_table_1 to place it there, but it hasn't been discovered yet. I should explore the other rooms to locate it.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n7. Thought: The sorting_table_1 has not been discovered in the current room (intake_bay). I need to explore other rooms to find it.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n8. Thought: The sorting_table_1 has not been discovered yet. I need to explore the current room (sorting_floor) to find it.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Sorting Floor and discovered 17 new objects\n9. Thought: The sorting_table_1 has been discovered in the current room (sorting_floor). Now I need to place the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) that I'm holding onto the sorting_table_1.\nAction: PLACE rubber_boot_1 on sorting_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach sorting_table_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: I need to approach the sorting_table_1 before I can place the rubber boot on it.\nAction: GOTO sorting_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Central Sorting Table (in Sorting Floor)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the sorting_table_1, I can place the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) that I'm holding onto it.\nAction: PLACE rubber_boot_1 on sorting_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Single Rubber Boot on Central Sorting Table\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
