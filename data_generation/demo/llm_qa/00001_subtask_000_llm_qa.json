Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been discovered in any explored rooms (Filter Simulation Station, Signal Generation & Testing Bay, or Storage & Component Shelves). The only remaining unexplored room is the Main Workbench Area, which is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been discovered in any explored rooms (Filter Simulation Station, Signal Generation & Testing Bay, or Storage & Component Shelves). The only remaining unexplored room is the Main Workbench Area, which is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n7. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been found in any explored rooms so far. The Main Workbench Area is the last unexplored room and is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. Exploring this room may reveal the target probe set needed for the task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been discovered in any explored rooms (Filter Simulation Station, Signal Generation & Testing Bay, or Storage & Component Shelves). The only remaining unexplored room is the Main Workbench Area, which is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n7. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been found in any explored rooms so far. The Main Workbench Area is the last unexplored room and is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. Exploring this room may reveal the target probe set needed for the task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n8. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has been discovered in the Main Workbench Area (on steel_workbench_1). The rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay. To complete the task, I need to: 1) Move to the probe set, 2) Grab it, 3) Go to the target room, 4) Move to the analyzer, and 5) Place the probe set on it. Since I'm currently in the Main Workbench Area, I should first move to the workbench where the probe set is located.\n\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been discovered in any explored rooms (Filter Simulation Station, Signal Generation & Testing Bay, or Storage & Component Shelves). The only remaining unexplored room is the Main Workbench Area, which is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n7. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been found in any explored rooms so far. The Main Workbench Area is the last unexplored room and is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. Exploring this room may reveal the target probe set needed for the task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n8. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has been discovered in the Main Workbench Area (on steel_workbench_1). The rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay. To complete the task, I need to: 1) Move to the probe set, 2) Grab it, 3) Go to the target room, 4) Move to the analyzer, and 5) Place the probe set on it. Since I'm currently in the Main Workbench Area, I should first move to the workbench where the probe set is located.\n\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the steel_workbench_1 where the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 is located. The next step is to pick up the probe set so it can be transported to the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay.\n\nAction: GRAB oscilloscope_probe_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Oscilloscope Probe Set\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been discovered in any explored rooms (Filter Simulation Station, Signal Generation & Testing Bay, or Storage & Component Shelves). The only remaining unexplored room is the Main Workbench Area, which is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n7. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been found in any explored rooms so far. The Main Workbench Area is the last unexplored room and is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. Exploring this room may reveal the target probe set needed for the task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n8. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has been discovered in the Main Workbench Area (on steel_workbench_1). The rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay. To complete the task, I need to: 1) Move to the probe set, 2) Grab it, 3) Go to the target room, 4) Move to the analyzer, and 5) Place the probe set on it. Since I'm currently in the Main Workbench Area, I should first move to the workbench where the probe set is located.\n\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the steel_workbench_1 where the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 is located. The next step is to pick up the probe set so it can be transported to the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay.\n\nAction: GRAB oscilloscope_probe_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Oscilloscope Probe Set\n10. Thought: The agent is holding the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and needs to place it on the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1, which is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay. The agent is currently in the Main Workbench Area, so it must first navigate to the target room where the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is located.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been discovered in any explored rooms (Filter Simulation Station, Signal Generation & Testing Bay, or Storage & Component Shelves). The only remaining unexplored room is the Main Workbench Area, which is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n7. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been found in any explored rooms so far. The Main Workbench Area is the last unexplored room and is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. Exploring this room may reveal the target probe set needed for the task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n8. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has been discovered in the Main Workbench Area (on steel_workbench_1). The rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay. To complete the task, I need to: 1) Move to the probe set, 2) Grab it, 3) Go to the target room, 4) Move to the analyzer, and 5) Place the probe set on it. Since I'm currently in the Main Workbench Area, I should first move to the workbench where the probe set is located.\n\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the steel_workbench_1 where the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 is located. The next step is to pick up the probe set so it can be transported to the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay.\n\nAction: GRAB oscilloscope_probe_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Oscilloscope Probe Set\n10. Thought: The agent is holding the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and needs to place it on the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1, which is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay.

Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since the agent is currently in the Filter Simulation Station, exploring this room first may reveal objects or pathways to other rooms where the target objects might be located.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Filter Simulation Station and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The target objects (oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1) are not in the current room (Filter Simulation Station). Since the Signal Generation & Testing Bay is specifically for testing equipment, it's the most likely location for the rack-mounted signal analyzer and associated probes. I should navigate there next to search for the objects.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n3. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer, both of which are likely located in this testing-focused room, I need to first discover objects in this room by exploring it.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Signal Generation & Testing Bay and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The task requires placing the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) onto the rack-mounted signal analyzer (rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1). After exploring the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is present (located in this room), but the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 hasn't been discovered yet. Since the Storage & Component Shelves room (type: storage) is a likely location for equipment like probe sets, I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO storage_component_shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Component Shelves\n5. Thought: The agent is currently in the Storage & Component Shelves room, which hasn't been explored yet. Since the oscilloscope probe set (oscilloscope_probe_set_1) wasn't found in previous rooms and storage areas typically contain equipment components, exploring this room may reveal the probe set. This is necessary before proceeding with the placement task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Component Shelves and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been discovered in any explored rooms (Filter Simulation Station, Signal Generation & Testing Bay, or Storage & Component Shelves). The only remaining unexplored room is the Main Workbench Area, which is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. I need to go there to search for the missing object.\n\nAction: GOTO main_workbench_area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Workbench Area\n7. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has not been found in any explored rooms so far. The Main Workbench Area is the last unexplored room and is likely to contain workbench equipment including probe sets. Exploring this room may reveal the target probe set needed for the task.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Workbench Area and discovered 18 new objects\n8. Thought: The oscilloscope_probe_set_1 has been discovered in the Main Workbench Area (on steel_workbench_1). The rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay. To complete the task, I need to: 1) Move to the probe set, 2) Grab it, 3) Go to the target room, 4) Move to the analyzer, and 5) Place the probe set on it. Since I'm currently in the Main Workbench Area, I should first move to the workbench where the probe set is located.\n\nAction: GOTO steel_workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached 6ft Steel Workbench (in Main Workbench Area)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the steel_workbench_1 where the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 is located. The next step is to pick up the probe set so it can be transported to the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay.\n\nAction: GRAB oscilloscope_probe_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Oscilloscope Probe Set\n10. Thought: The agent is holding the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 and needs to place it on the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1, which is located in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay. The agent is currently in the Main Workbench Area, so it must first navigate to the target room where the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 is located.\n\nAction: GOTO signal_generation_testing_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n11. Thought: The agent is currently in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay and holding the oscilloscope probe set. To place it on the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1, the agent must first move to the specific analyzer location within the room.\nAction: GOTO rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Rack-Mounted Signal Analyzer (in Signal Generation & Testing Bay)\n12. Thought: The agent is currently at the rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1 location in the Signal Generation & Testing Bay, holding the oscilloscope_probe_set_1. The final task requirement is to place this probe set onto the analyzer, which can now be executed directly.\n\nAction: PLACE oscilloscope_probe_set_1 on rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Oscilloscope Probe Set on Rack-Mounted Signal Analyzer\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The task required placing the oscilloscope_probe_set_1 onto rack_mounted_signal_analyzer_1. The action history shows that in step 12, the PLACE action was executed successfully, confirming the probe set is now on the signal analyzer. The task is complete.\nAction: DONE",
