Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay has been explored, but no repair tools were found. The Storage & Logistics Corner likely contains tools needed to repair the coffee machine. I should move there to search for repair equipment.\nAction: GOTO storage_logistics_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The Storage & Logistics Corner has not been explored yet. Since this is a storage area, it may contain tools or parts needed to repair the broken coffee machine. I need to explore this room to discover potential repair items before proceeding.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Logistics Corner and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is located on the Rolling Tool Cart (rolling_tool_cart_1) in the current room. Since the cart is currently closed (is_open: False), I need to open it first to access the repair kit for the coffee machine repair task.\nAction: OPEN rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Rolling Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to repair the broken coffee machine in the break room. Currently, no objects are discovered in the Break Room & Archive Nook where the agent is located. To find the coffee machine and any potential repair tools, the agent must first explore the current room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room & Archive Nook and discovered 15 new objects\n2. Thought: The broken coffee machine (broken_coffee_machine_1) is in the break room, but no repair tools were found during exploration. Since the Technical Workstation Bay (technical_workstation_bay) is designated as a technical area, it likely contains repair tools needed for the task. I should move there to search for appropriate tools.\nAction: GOTO technical_workstation_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Technical Workstation Bay\n3. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay is a technical area and likely contains repair tools needed for fixing the coffee machine. Since no objects have been discovered in this room yet, I need to explore it to find potential repair tools.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Technical Workstation Bay and discovered 9 new objects\n4. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay has been explored, but no repair tools were found. The Storage & Logistics Corner likely contains tools needed to repair the coffee machine. I should move there to search for repair equipment.\nAction: GOTO storage_logistics_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The Storage & Logistics Corner has not been explored yet. Since this is a storage area, it may contain tools or parts needed to repair the broken coffee machine. I need to explore this room to discover potential repair items before proceeding.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Logistics Corner and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is located on the Rolling Tool Cart (rolling_tool_cart_1) in the current room. Since the cart is currently closed (is_open: False), I need to open it first to access the repair kit for the coffee machine repair task.\nAction: OPEN rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Rolling Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n7. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is now accessible on the open Rolling Tool Cart. Since the task requires repairing the coffee machine and the repair kit provides the necessary 'repair' ability, I need to grab it first to gain that capability. This will allow me to fix the broken coffee machine later.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Repair Kit before grabbing\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The broken coffee machine (broken_coffee_machine_1) is in the break room, but no repair tools were found during exploration. Since the Technical Workstation Bay (technical_workstation_bay) is designated as a technical area, it likely contains repair tools needed for the task. I should move there to search for appropriate tools.\nAction: GOTO technical_workstation_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Technical Workstation Bay\n3. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay is a technical area and likely contains repair tools needed for fixing the coffee machine. Since no objects have been discovered in this room yet, I need to explore it to find potential repair tools.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Technical Workstation Bay and discovered 9 new objects\n4. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay has been explored, but no repair tools were found. The Storage & Logistics Corner likely contains tools needed to repair the coffee machine. I should move there to search for repair equipment.\nAction: GOTO storage_logistics_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The Storage & Logistics Corner has not been explored yet. Since this is a storage area, it may contain tools or parts needed to repair the broken coffee machine. I need to explore this room to discover potential repair items before proceeding.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Logistics Corner and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is located on the Rolling Tool Cart (rolling_tool_cart_1) in the current room. Since the cart is currently closed (is_open: False), I need to open it first to access the repair kit for the coffee machine repair task.\nAction: OPEN rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Rolling Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n7. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is now accessible on the open Rolling Tool Cart. Since the task requires repairing the coffee machine and the repair kit provides the necessary 'repair' ability, I need to grab it first to gain that capability. This will allow me to fix the broken coffee machine later.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Repair Kit before grabbing\n8. Thought: The GRAB action failed because the agent wasn't close enough to the repair kit. I need to approach the Rolling Tool Cart first before attempting to grab the repair kit. The repair kit is essential for repairing the coffee machine, so I must retrieve it.\nAction: GOTO rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Rolling Tool Cart (in Storage & Logistics Corner)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The agent is now at the Rolling Tool Cart, which contains the Repair Kit. Since the GRAB action previously failed due to proximity, being at the cart should allow successful retrieval of the Repair Kit.

Thought: The task is to repair the broken coffee machine in the break room. Currently, no objects are discovered in the Break Room & Archive Nook where the agent is located. To find the coffee machine and any potential repair tools, the agent must first explore the current room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room & Archive Nook and discovered 15 new objects\n2. Thought: The broken coffee machine (broken_coffee_machine_1) is in the break room, but no repair tools were found during exploration. Since the Technical Workstation Bay (technical_workstation_bay) is designated as a technical area, it likely contains repair tools needed for the task. I should move there to search for appropriate tools.\nAction: GOTO technical_workstation_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Technical Workstation Bay\n3. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay is a technical area and likely contains repair tools needed for fixing the coffee machine. Since no objects have been discovered in this room yet, I need to explore it to find potential repair tools.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Technical Workstation Bay and discovered 9 new objects\n4. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay has been explored, but no repair tools were found. The Storage & Logistics Corner likely contains tools needed to repair the coffee machine. I should move there to search for repair equipment.\nAction: GOTO storage_logistics_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The Storage & Logistics Corner has not been explored yet. Since this is a storage area, it may contain tools or parts needed to repair the broken coffee machine. I need to explore this room to discover potential repair items before proceeding.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Logistics Corner and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is located on the Rolling Tool Cart (rolling_tool_cart_1) in the current room. Since the cart is currently closed (is_open: False), I need to open it first to access the repair kit for the coffee machine repair task.\nAction: OPEN rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Rolling Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n7. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is now accessible on the open Rolling Tool Cart. Since the task requires repairing the coffee machine and the repair kit provides the necessary 'repair' ability, I need to grab it first to gain that capability. This will allow me to fix the broken coffee machine later.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Repair Kit before grabbing\n8. Thought: The GRAB action failed because the agent wasn't close enough to the repair kit. I need to approach the Rolling Tool Cart first before attempting to grab the repair kit. The repair kit is essential for repairing the coffee machine, so I must retrieve it.\nAction: GOTO rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Rolling Tool Cart (in Storage & Logistics Corner)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the Rolling Tool Cart, which contains the Repair Kit. Since the GRAB action previously failed due to proximity, being at the cart should allow successful retrieval of the Repair Kit. This tool provides the 'repair' ability needed to fix the coffee machine.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Repair Kit\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to repair the broken coffee machine in the break room. Currently, no objects are discovered in the Break Room & Archive Nook where the agent is located. To find the coffee machine and any potential repair tools, the agent must first explore the current room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room & Archive Nook and discovered 15 new objects\n2. Thought: The broken coffee machine (broken_coffee_machine_1) is in the break room, but no repair tools were found during exploration. Since the Technical Workstation Bay (technical_workstation_bay) is designated as a technical area, it likely contains repair tools needed for the task. I should move there to search for appropriate tools.\nAction: GOTO technical_workstation_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Technical Workstation Bay\n3. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay is a technical area and likely contains repair tools needed for fixing the coffee machine. Since no objects have been discovered in this room yet, I need to explore it to find potential repair tools.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Technical Workstation Bay and discovered 9 new objects\n4. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay has been explored, but no repair tools were found. The Storage & Logistics Corner likely contains tools needed to repair the coffee machine. I should move there to search for repair equipment.\nAction: GOTO storage_logistics_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The Storage & Logistics Corner has not been explored yet. Since this is a storage area, it may contain tools or parts needed to repair the broken coffee machine. I need to explore this room to discover potential repair items before proceeding.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Logistics Corner and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is located on the Rolling Tool Cart (rolling_tool_cart_1) in the current room. Since the cart is currently closed (is_open: False), I need to open it first to access the repair kit for the coffee machine repair task.\nAction: OPEN rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Rolling Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n7. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is now accessible on the open Rolling Tool Cart. Since the task requires repairing the coffee machine and the repair kit provides the necessary 'repair' ability, I need to grab it first to gain that capability. This will allow me to fix the broken coffee machine later.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Repair Kit before grabbing\n8. Thought: The GRAB action failed because the agent wasn't close enough to the repair kit. I need to approach the Rolling Tool Cart first before attempting to grab the repair kit. The repair kit is essential for repairing the coffee machine, so I must retrieve it.\nAction: GOTO rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Rolling Tool Cart (in Storage & Logistics Corner)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the Rolling Tool Cart, which contains the Repair Kit. Since the GRAB action previously failed due to proximity, being at the cart should allow successful retrieval of the Repair Kit. This tool provides the 'repair' ability needed to fix the coffee machine.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Repair Kit\n10. Thought: I have the repair kit and need to repair the broken coffee machine in the Break Room & Archive Nook. Since I'm currently in the Storage & Logistics Corner, I must first move to the break room where the coffee machine is located.\nAction: GOTO break_room_archive_nook\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Break Room & Archive Nook\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to repair the broken coffee machine in the break room. Currently, no objects are discovered in the Break Room & Archive Nook where the agent is located. To find the coffee machine and any potential repair tools, the agent must first explore the current room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room & Archive Nook and discovered 15 new objects\n2. Thought: The broken coffee machine (broken_coffee_machine_1) is in the break room, but no repair tools were found during exploration. Since the Technical Workstation Bay (technical_workstation_bay) is designated as a technical area, it likely contains repair tools needed for the task. I should move there to search for appropriate tools.\nAction: GOTO technical_workstation_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Technical Workstation Bay\n3. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay is a technical area and likely contains repair tools needed for fixing the coffee machine. Since no objects have been discovered in this room yet, I need to explore it to find potential repair tools.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Technical Workstation Bay and discovered 9 new objects\n4. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay has been explored, but no repair tools were found. The Storage & Logistics Corner likely contains tools needed to repair the coffee machine. I should move there to search for repair equipment.\nAction: GOTO storage_logistics_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The Storage & Logistics Corner has not been explored yet. Since this is a storage area, it may contain tools or parts needed to repair the broken coffee machine. I need to explore this room to discover potential repair items before proceeding.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Logistics Corner and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is located on the Rolling Tool Cart (rolling_tool_cart_1) in the current room. Since the cart is currently closed (is_open: False), I need to open it first to access the repair kit for the coffee machine repair task.\nAction: OPEN rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Rolling Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n7. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is now accessible on the open Rolling Tool Cart. Since the task requires repairing the coffee machine and the repair kit provides the necessary 'repair' ability, I need to grab it first to gain that capability. This will allow me to fix the broken coffee machine later.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Repair Kit before grabbing\n8. Thought: The GRAB action failed because the agent wasn't close enough to the repair kit. I need to approach the Rolling Tool Cart first before attempting to grab the repair kit. The repair kit is essential for repairing the coffee machine, so I must retrieve it.\nAction: GOTO rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Rolling Tool Cart (in Storage & Logistics Corner)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the Rolling Tool Cart, which contains the Repair Kit. Since the GRAB action previously failed due to proximity, being at the cart should allow successful retrieval of the Repair Kit. This tool provides the 'repair' ability needed to fix the coffee machine.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Repair Kit\n10. Thought: I have the repair kit and need to repair the broken coffee machine in the Break Room & Archive Nook. Since I'm currently in the Storage & Logistics Corner, I must first move to the break room where the coffee machine is located.\nAction: GOTO break_room_archive_nook\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Break Room & Archive Nook\n11. Thought: The agent is now in the Break Room & Archive Nook with the repair kit and needs to repair the broken coffee machine. Since the coffee machine is in this room but the agent may not be close to it yet, I need to approach the coffee machine first before attempting the repair.\n\nAction: GOTO broken_coffee_machine_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Broken Coffee Machine (in Break Room & Archive Nook)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to repair the broken coffee machine in the break room. Currently, no objects are discovered in the Break Room & Archive Nook where the agent is located. To find the coffee machine and any potential repair tools, the agent must first explore the current room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room & Archive Nook and discovered 15 new objects\n2. Thought: The broken coffee machine (broken_coffee_machine_1) is in the break room, but no repair tools were found during exploration. Since the Technical Workstation Bay (technical_workstation_bay) is designated as a technical area, it likely contains repair tools needed for the task. I should move there to search for appropriate tools.\nAction: GOTO technical_workstation_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Technical Workstation Bay\n3. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay is a technical area and likely contains repair tools needed for fixing the coffee machine. Since no objects have been discovered in this room yet, I need to explore it to find potential repair tools.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Technical Workstation Bay and discovered 9 new objects\n4. Thought: The Technical Workstation Bay has been explored, but no repair tools were found. The Storage & Logistics Corner likely contains tools needed to repair the coffee machine. I should move there to search for repair equipment.\nAction: GOTO storage_logistics_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The Storage & Logistics Corner has not been explored yet. Since this is a storage area, it may contain tools or parts needed to repair the broken coffee machine. I need to explore this room to discover potential repair items before proceeding.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Storage & Logistics Corner and discovered 13 new objects\n6. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is located on the Rolling Tool Cart (rolling_tool_cart_1) in the current room. Since the cart is currently closed (is_open: False), I need to open it first to access the repair kit for the coffee machine repair task.\nAction: OPEN rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Rolling Tool Cart, is_open changed from False to True\n7. Thought: The repair kit (repair_kit_1) is now accessible on the open Rolling Tool Cart. Since the task requires repairing the coffee machine and the repair kit provides the necessary 'repair' ability, I need to grab it first to gain that capability. This will allow me to fix the broken coffee machine later.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Repair Kit before grabbing\n8. Thought: The GRAB action failed because the agent wasn't close enough to the repair kit. I need to approach the Rolling Tool Cart first before attempting to grab the repair kit. The repair kit is essential for repairing the coffee machine, so I must retrieve it.\nAction: GOTO rolling_tool_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Rolling Tool Cart (in Storage & Logistics Corner)\n9. Thought: The agent is now at the Rolling Tool Cart, which contains the Repair Kit. Since the GRAB action previously failed due to proximity, being at the cart should allow successful retrieval of the Repair Kit. This tool provides the 'repair' ability needed to fix the coffee machine.\n\nAction: GRAB repair_kit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Repair Kit\n10. Thought: I have the repair kit and need to repair the broken coffee machine in the Break Room & Archive Nook. Since I'm currently in the Storage & Logistics Corner, I must first move to the break room where the coffee machine is located.\nAction: GOTO break_room_archive_nook\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Break Room & Archive Nook\n11. Thought: The agent is now in the Break Room & Archive Nook with the repair kit and needs to repair the broken coffee machine. Since the coffee machine is in this room but the agent may not be close to it yet, I need to approach the coffee machine first before attempting the repair.\n\nAction: GOTO broken_coffee_machine_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Broken Coffee Machine (in Break Room & Archive Nook)\n12. Thought: The agent is at the broken coffee machine with the repair kit in inventory, which provides the 'repair' ability. The task requires repairing this specific machine, so executing the REPAIR action now will complete the objective.\nAction: REPAIR broken_coffee_machine_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed repair on Broken Coffee Machine, is_broken changed from True to False\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
