Thought: The current room (equipment_storage_lounge) has been explored, but no studio monitors were found.

Thought: The Main Control Room exploration revealed two black Genelec 8351B studio monitors, but both weigh 50kg which exceeds the agent's 10kg carrying capacity. Since no other rooms contain studio monitors and the Vocal Isolation Booth remains unexplored (potentially containing a lighter monitor), I must investigate that room next.\n\nAction: GOTO vocal_isolation_booth\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Vocal Isolation Booth\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been discovered in any room yet. I need to explore the current room (equipment_storage_lounge) first to find potential studio monitors since storage areas are likely to contain equipment like studio monitors.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Equipment Storage & Lounge and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The current room (equipment_storage_lounge) has been explored, but no studio monitors were found. The task requires finding a black studio monitor, which is likely to be in rooms designed for recording or control. The Live Recording Room (live_recording_room) is the most probable location for such equipment since it's a dedicated recording space. I need to move there to explore.\n\nAction: GOTO live_recording_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Live Recording Room\n3. Thought: The Live Recording Room has not been explored yet, and studio monitors are likely to be found in recording spaces. Since the task requires finding a black studio monitor and placing it in this room, I need to explore the current room to discover any potential monitors.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Live Recording Room and discovered 8 new objects\n4. Thought: The Live Recording Room has been explored, but no studio monitors were found. The Main Control Room is the most likely location for studio monitors, as it is a control room typically equipped with audio monitoring equipment. I need to move there to explore.\n\nAction: GOTO main_control_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Control Room\n5. Thought: The Main Control Room has not been explored yet, and studio monitors are typically found in control rooms for audio monitoring. Since the task requires finding a black studio monitor, exploring this room is necessary to discover potential candidates.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Control Room and discovered 12 new objects\n6. Thought: The Main Control Room exploration revealed two black Genelec 8351B studio monitors, but both weigh 50kg which exceeds the agent's 10kg carrying capacity. Since no other rooms contain studio monitors and the Vocal Isolation Booth remains unexplored (potentially containing a lighter monitor), I must investigate that room next.\n\nAction: GOTO vocal_isolation_booth\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Vocal Isolation Booth\n7. Thought: The Vocal Isolation Booth has not been explored yet and may contain studio monitors. Since the Genelec monitors in the control room exceed my 10kg carrying capacity, I must check this last room for potential lighter black studio monitors that meet the task requirements.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Vocal Isolation Booth and discovered 7 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: After exploring all rooms, the only black studio monitors found are the two Genelec 8351B monitors in the main_control_room, each weighing 50kg. This exceeds the agent's 10kg carrying capacity, making it impossible to move them. No other black studio monitors exist in the environment.
