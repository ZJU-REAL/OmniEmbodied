I need to check other rooms for the plant.\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n3. Thought: The pothos_plant_1 is not in the break room or main newsroom. I need to explore the main newsroom to find it.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n4. Thought: The pruning_shears_1 is in the break room and the pothos_plant_1 is in the main newsroom. I need to go to the break room to grab the pruning shears first.\nAction: GOTO break_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Break Room\n5. Thought: The pruning_shears_1 is in the break room and I need to grab it before I can prune the pothos_plant_1 in the main newsroom.\nAction: GRAB pruning_shears_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Pruning Shears before grabbing\n6. Thought: The pruning_shears_1 is in the break room but I need to approach it before grabbing. I should go to the pruning shears first.\nAction: GOTO pruning_shears_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Pruning Shears (in Break Room)\n7. Thought: Now that I have approached the pruning_shears_1, I can grab it to prepare for pruning the pothos_plant_1 in the main newsroom.\nAction: GRAB pruning_shears_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Pruning Shears\n8. Thought: I have successfully grabbed the pruning_shears_1 and need to go to the main newsroom where the pothos_plant_1 is located to perform the pruning.\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n9. Thought: I have the pruning_shears_1 in my inventory and I'm in the same room as the pothos_plant_1. Now I need to approach the plant to prune it.\nAction: GOTO pothos_plant_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Dying Pothos Plant (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n10. Thought: I have approached the pothos_plant_1 and have the pruning_shears_1 in my inventory. Now I can perform the pruning action.\nAction: PRUNE pothos_plant_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed prune on Dying Pothos Plant, is_pruned changed from False to True\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
