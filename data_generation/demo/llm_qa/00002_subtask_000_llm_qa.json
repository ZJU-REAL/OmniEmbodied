Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. No objects are discovered in any room yet, including the current Break Room. Since I need to locate both the phone and the desk, I must first explore the current room to reveal any objects here. This is the most efficient starting point as I'm already in the Break Room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: The Break Room has been explored, revealing gardening tools and furniture but no burner phone or editor's desk. Since the task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1, I need to search other rooms. The editor's desk is most likely located in the Editor's Glass Office (editors_office), so I should move there next to explore for relevant objects.\n\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. Currently in Editor's Glass Office where no objects have been discovered yet. Since the editor's desk is likely located in this room, I need to explore here first to identify available objects including the desk and potentially the burner phone.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is not present in the Editor's Glass Office or Break Room based on exploration results. Since the Secure Evidence Storage Room is a likely location for evidentiary items like burner phones, I should search there next.\n\nAction: GOTO secure_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Secure Evidence Storage Room\n5. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been located in previously explored rooms (Break Room and Editor's Glass Office). Since Secure Evidence Storage Room is specifically designed for storing evidentiary items like burner phones, I need to explore this current room to discover available objects, including the burner phone. Once found, I can proceed with retrieval and placement.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Secure Evidence Storage Room and discovered 11 new objects\n6. Thought: After exploring the Secure Evidence Storage Room, the burner_phone_1 still hasn't been discovered. Since the Main Newsroom Floor and Forensic Digitization Station remain unexplored, and burner phones are typically evidence items that might be in digitization areas or open workspaces, I should search the Main Newsroom Floor next as it's a high-traffic area where such items could be located.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n7. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been found in any explored rooms (Break Room, Editor's Office, Secure Storage). Since the Main Newsroom Floor is currently unexplored and is a high-traffic area where evidence might be temporarily placed, I need to explore this room to locate the burner phone. This is the last unexplored area besides the Digitization Station, making it a priority search location.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. No objects are discovered in any room yet, including the current Break Room. Since I need to locate both the phone and the desk, I must first explore the current room to reveal any objects here. This is the most efficient starting point as I'm already in the Break Room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: The Break Room has been explored, revealing gardening tools and furniture but no burner phone or editor's desk. Since the task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1, I need to search other rooms. The editor's desk is most likely located in the Editor's Glass Office (editors_office), so I should move there next to explore for relevant objects.\n\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. Currently in Editor's Glass Office where no objects have been discovered yet. Since the editor's desk is likely located in this room, I need to explore here first to identify available objects including the desk and potentially the burner phone.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is not present in the Editor's Glass Office or Break Room based on exploration results. Since the Secure Evidence Storage Room is a likely location for evidentiary items like burner phones, I should search there next.\n\nAction: GOTO secure_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Secure Evidence Storage Room\n5. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been located in previously explored rooms (Break Room and Editor's Glass Office). Since Secure Evidence Storage Room is specifically designed for storing evidentiary items like burner phones, I need to explore this current room to discover available objects, including the burner phone. Once found, I can proceed with retrieval and placement.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Secure Evidence Storage Room and discovered 11 new objects\n6. Thought: After exploring the Secure Evidence Storage Room, the burner_phone_1 still hasn't been discovered. Since the Main Newsroom Floor and Forensic Digitization Station remain unexplored, and burner phones are typically evidence items that might be in digitization areas or open workspaces, I should search the Main Newsroom Floor next as it's a high-traffic area where such items could be located.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n7. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been found in any explored rooms (Break Room, Editor's Office, Secure Storage). Since the Main Newsroom Floor is currently unexplored and is a high-traffic area where evidence might be temporarily placed, I need to explore this room to locate the burner phone. This is the last unexplored area besides the Digitization Station, making it a priority search location.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n8. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has been located on the Collaborative Worktable (worktable_1) in the Main Newsroom Floor. I need to grab it first. Since I'm already in the same room, I should move to the worktable to access the phone.\nAction: GOTO worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaborative Worktable (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. No objects are discovered in any room yet, including the current Break Room. Since I need to locate both the phone and the desk, I must first explore the current room to reveal any objects here. This is the most efficient starting point as I'm already in the Break Room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: The Break Room has been explored, revealing gardening tools and furniture but no burner phone or editor's desk. Since the task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1, I need to search other rooms. The editor's desk is most likely located in the Editor's Glass Office (editors_office), so I should move there next to explore for relevant objects.\n\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. Currently in Editor's Glass Office where no objects have been discovered yet. Since the editor's desk is likely located in this room, I need to explore here first to identify available objects including the desk and potentially the burner phone.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is not present in the Editor's Glass Office or Break Room based on exploration results. Since the Secure Evidence Storage Room is a likely location for evidentiary items like burner phones, I should search there next.\n\nAction: GOTO secure_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Secure Evidence Storage Room\n5. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been located in previously explored rooms (Break Room and Editor's Glass Office). Since Secure Evidence Storage Room is specifically designed for storing evidentiary items like burner phones, I need to explore this current room to discover available objects, including the burner phone. Once found, I can proceed with retrieval and placement.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Secure Evidence Storage Room and discovered 11 new objects\n6. Thought: After exploring the Secure Evidence Storage Room, the burner_phone_1 still hasn't been discovered.

Since the task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1, I need to search other rooms. The editor's desk is most likely located in the Editor's Glass Office (editors_office), so I should move there next to explore for relevant objects.\n\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. Currently in Editor's Glass Office where no objects have been discovered yet. Since the editor's desk is likely located in this room, I need to explore here first to identify available objects including the desk and potentially the burner phone.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is not present in the Editor's Glass Office or Break Room based on exploration results. Since the Secure Evidence Storage Room is a likely location for evidentiary items like burner phones, I should search there next.\n\nAction: GOTO secure_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Secure Evidence Storage Room\n5. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been located in previously explored rooms (Break Room and Editor's Glass Office). Since Secure Evidence Storage Room is specifically designed for storing evidentiary items like burner phones, I need to explore this current room to discover available objects, including the burner phone. Once found, I can proceed with retrieval and placement.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Secure Evidence Storage Room and discovered 11 new objects\n6. Thought: After exploring the Secure Evidence Storage Room, the burner_phone_1 still hasn't been discovered. Since the Main Newsroom Floor and Forensic Digitization Station remain unexplored, and burner phones are typically evidence items that might be in digitization areas or open workspaces, I should search the Main Newsroom Floor next as it's a high-traffic area where such items could be located.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n7. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been found in any explored rooms (Break Room, Editor's Office, Secure Storage). Since the Main Newsroom Floor is currently unexplored and is a high-traffic area where evidence might be temporarily placed, I need to explore this room to locate the burner phone. This is the last unexplored area besides the Digitization Station, making it a priority search location.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n8. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has been located on the Collaborative Worktable (worktable_1) in the Main Newsroom Floor. I need to grab it first. Since I'm already in the same room, I should move to the worktable to access the phone.\nAction: GOTO worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaborative Worktable (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n9. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is now within reach at the Collaborative Worktable. I need to grab it before transporting it to the Editor's Glass Office.\nAction: GRAB burner_phone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Burner Phone in Faraday Cage\n10. Thought: I have the burner_phone_1 in my inventory and need to place it on editors_desk_1 in Editor's Glass Office. Since I'm currently in Main Newsroom Floor, I must first move to the target desk location.\nAction: GOTO editors_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Editor's Glass Office，再靠近Editor's Desk\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. No objects are discovered in any room yet, including the current Break Room. Since I need to locate both the phone and the desk, I must first explore the current room to reveal any objects here. This is the most efficient starting point as I'm already in the Break Room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: The Break Room has been explored, revealing gardening tools and furniture but no burner phone or editor's desk. Since the task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1, I need to search other rooms. The editor's desk is most likely located in the Editor's Glass Office (editors_office), so I should move there next to explore for relevant objects.\n\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. Currently in Editor's Glass Office where no objects have been discovered yet. Since the editor's desk is likely located in this room, I need to explore here first to identify available objects including the desk and potentially the burner phone.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is not present in the Editor's Glass Office or Break Room based on exploration results. Since the Secure Evidence Storage Room is a likely location for evidentiary items like burner phones, I should search there next.\n\nAction: GOTO secure_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Secure Evidence Storage Room\n5. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been located in previously explored rooms (Break Room and Editor's Glass Office). Since Secure Evidence Storage Room is specifically designed for storing evidentiary items like burner phones, I need to explore this current room to discover available objects, including the burner phone. Once found, I can proceed with retrieval and placement.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Secure Evidence Storage Room and discovered 11 new objects\n6. Thought: After exploring the Secure Evidence Storage Room, the burner_phone_1 still hasn't been discovered. Since the Main Newsroom Floor and Forensic Digitization Station remain unexplored, and burner phones are typically evidence items that might be in digitization areas or open workspaces, I should search the Main Newsroom Floor next as it's a high-traffic area where such items could be located.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n7. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been found in any explored rooms (Break Room, Editor's Office, Secure Storage). Since the Main Newsroom Floor is currently unexplored and is a high-traffic area where evidence might be temporarily placed, I need to explore this room to locate the burner phone. This is the last unexplored area besides the Digitization Station, making it a priority search location.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n8. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has been located on the Collaborative Worktable (worktable_1) in the Main Newsroom Floor. I need to grab it first. Since I'm already in the same room, I should move to the worktable to access the phone.\nAction: GOTO worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaborative Worktable (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n9. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is now within reach at the Collaborative Worktable. I need to grab it before transporting it to the Editor's Glass Office.\nAction: GRAB burner_phone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Burner Phone in Faraday Cage\n10. Thought: I have the burner_phone_1 in my inventory and need to place it on editors_desk_1 in Editor's Glass Office. Since I'm currently in Main Newsroom Floor, I must first move to the target desk location.\nAction: GOTO editors_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Editor's Glass Office，再靠近Editor's Desk\n11. Thought: The previous attempt to directly go to editors_desk_1 from Main Newsroom Floor failed because the desk is located in Editor's Glass Office. I need to first move to the Editor's Glass Office room before approaching the specific desk object.\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. No objects are discovered in any room yet, including the current Break Room. Since I need to locate both the phone and the desk, I must first explore the current room to reveal any objects here. This is the most efficient starting point as I'm already in the Break Room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: The Break Room has been explored, revealing gardening tools and furniture but no burner phone or editor's desk. Since the task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1, I need to search other rooms. The editor's desk is most likely located in the Editor's Glass Office (editors_office), so I should move there next to explore for relevant objects.\n\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. Currently in Editor's Glass Office where no objects have been discovered yet. Since the editor's desk is likely located in this room, I need to explore here first to identify available objects including the desk and potentially the burner phone.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is not present in the Editor's Glass Office or Break Room based on exploration results. Since the Secure Evidence Storage Room is a likely location for evidentiary items like burner phones, I should search there next.\n\nAction: GOTO secure_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Secure Evidence Storage Room\n5. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been located in previously explored rooms (Break Room and Editor's Glass Office). Since Secure Evidence Storage Room is specifically designed for storing evidentiary items like burner phones, I need to explore this current room to discover available objects, including the burner phone. Once found, I can proceed with retrieval and placement.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Secure Evidence Storage Room and discovered 11 new objects\n6. Thought: After exploring the Secure Evidence Storage Room, the burner_phone_1 still hasn't been discovered. Since the Main Newsroom Floor and Forensic Digitization Station remain unexplored, and burner phones are typically evidence items that might be in digitization areas or open workspaces, I should search the Main Newsroom Floor next as it's a high-traffic area where such items could be located.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n7. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been found in any explored rooms (Break Room, Editor's Office, Secure Storage). Since the Main Newsroom Floor is currently unexplored and is a high-traffic area where evidence might be temporarily placed, I need to explore this room to locate the burner phone. This is the last unexplored area besides the Digitization Station, making it a priority search location.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n8. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has been located on the Collaborative Worktable (worktable_1) in the Main Newsroom Floor. I need to grab it first. Since I'm already in the same room, I should move to the worktable to access the phone.\nAction: GOTO worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaborative Worktable (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n9. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is now within reach at the Collaborative Worktable. I need to grab it before transporting it to the Editor's Glass Office.\nAction: GRAB burner_phone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Burner Phone in Faraday Cage\n10. Thought: I have the burner_phone_1 in my inventory and need to place it on editors_desk_1 in Editor's Glass Office. Since I'm currently in Main Newsroom Floor, I must first move to the target desk location.\nAction: GOTO editors_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Editor's Glass Office，再靠近Editor's Desk\n11. Thought: The previous attempt to directly go to editors_desk_1 from Main Newsroom Floor failed because the desk is located in Editor's Glass Office. I need to first move to the Editor's Glass Office room before approaching the specific desk object.\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n12. Thought: I am currently in the Editor's Glass Office with burner_phone_1 in my inventory. The target editors_desk_1 is in this same room. I need to approach the desk first to be in proximity for placing the item.\nAction: GOTO editors_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Editor's Desk (in Editor's Glass Office)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. No objects are discovered in any room yet, including the current Break Room. Since I need to locate both the phone and the desk, I must first explore the current room to reveal any objects here. This is the most efficient starting point as I'm already in the Break Room.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Break Room and discovered 5 new objects\n2. Thought: The Break Room has been explored, revealing gardening tools and furniture but no burner phone or editor's desk. Since the task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1, I need to search other rooms. The editor's desk is most likely located in the Editor's Glass Office (editors_office), so I should move there next to explore for relevant objects.\n\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The task requires placing burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1. Currently in Editor's Glass Office where no objects have been discovered yet. Since the editor's desk is likely located in this room, I need to explore here first to identify available objects including the desk and potentially the burner phone.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is not present in the Editor's Glass Office or Break Room based on exploration results. Since the Secure Evidence Storage Room is a likely location for evidentiary items like burner phones, I should search there next.\n\nAction: GOTO secure_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Secure Evidence Storage Room\n5. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been located in previously explored rooms (Break Room and Editor's Glass Office). Since Secure Evidence Storage Room is specifically designed for storing evidentiary items like burner phones, I need to explore this current room to discover available objects, including the burner phone. Once found, I can proceed with retrieval and placement.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Secure Evidence Storage Room and discovered 11 new objects\n6. Thought: After exploring the Secure Evidence Storage Room, the burner_phone_1 still hasn't been discovered. Since the Main Newsroom Floor and Forensic Digitization Station remain unexplored, and burner phones are typically evidence items that might be in digitization areas or open workspaces, I should search the Main Newsroom Floor next as it's a high-traffic area where such items could be located.\n\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n7. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has not been found in any explored rooms (Break Room, Editor's Office, Secure Storage). Since the Main Newsroom Floor is currently unexplored and is a high-traffic area where evidence might be temporarily placed, I need to explore this room to locate the burner phone. This is the last unexplored area besides the Digitization Station, making it a priority search location.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n8. Thought: The burner_phone_1 has been located on the Collaborative Worktable (worktable_1) in the Main Newsroom Floor. I need to grab it first. Since I'm already in the same room, I should move to the worktable to access the phone.\nAction: GOTO worktable_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Collaborative Worktable (in Main Newsroom Floor)\n9. Thought: The burner_phone_1 is now within reach at the Collaborative Worktable. I need to grab it before transporting it to the Editor's Glass Office.\nAction: GRAB burner_phone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Burner Phone in Faraday Cage\n10. Thought: I have the burner_phone_1 in my inventory and need to place it on editors_desk_1 in Editor's Glass Office. Since I'm currently in Main Newsroom Floor, I must first move to the target desk location.\nAction: GOTO editors_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Editor's Glass Office，再靠近Editor's Desk\n11. Thought: The previous attempt to directly go to editors_desk_1 from Main Newsroom Floor failed because the desk is located in Editor's Glass Office. I need to first move to the Editor's Glass Office room before approaching the specific desk object.\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n12. Thought: I am currently in the Editor's Glass Office with burner_phone_1 in my inventory. The target editors_desk_1 is in this same room. I need to approach the desk first to be in proximity for placing the item.\nAction: GOTO editors_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Editor's Desk (in Editor's Glass Office)\n13. Thought: I have the burner_phone_1 in my inventory and am currently at the editors_desk_1 in Editor's Glass Office. The final task step is to place the burner phone on the desk.\nAction: PLACE burner_phone_1 on editors_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Burner Phone in Faraday Cage on Editor's Desk\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
