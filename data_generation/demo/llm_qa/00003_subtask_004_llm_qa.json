Thought: The task requires repairing the broken apollo_twin_x_1 with a soldering_iron_1, but no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since I'm currently in the Equipment Storage & Lounge room, I should explore this room first to locate the necessary tools or components.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Equipment Storage & Lounge and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The apollo_twin_x_1 is not present in the current room (Equipment Storage & Lounge). Since the Main Control Room is the most likely location for audio equipment like the Apollo Twin interface, I should go there to search for it.\n\nAction: GOTO main_control_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Control Room\n3. Thought: The apollo_twin_x_1 is likely in the Main Control Room since it's audio equipment, but no objects have been discovered here yet. I need to explore this room to locate the broken device before retrieving the soldering iron.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Control Room and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The apollo_twin_x_1 is located in the Main Control Room, but the soldering_iron_1 required for repair is in the Equipment Storage & Lounge. Since I'm currently in the Main Control Room, I need to move to the Equipment Storage & Lounge to retrieve the soldering iron.\nAction: GOTO equipment_storage_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Equipment Storage & Lounge\n5. Thought: I have successfully moved to the Equipment Storage & Lounge where the soldering_iron_1 is located. To repair the apollo_twin_x_1, I first need to acquire the soldering iron since it provides the repair ability. The soldering_iron_1 is currently on top of the steel_rack_1 and accessible without opening the container.\n\nAction: GRAB soldering_iron_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Soldering Iron before grabbing\n6. Thought: The GRAB action failed because I must approach the soldering_iron_1 first. Since it's located on top of steel_rack_1, I need to move to that furniture before attempting to grab the tool.\nAction: GOTO steel_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Industrial Rack (in Equipment Storage & Lounge)\n7. Thought: I have successfully approached the Industrial Rack where the soldering_iron_1 is located. Now I can grab it directly since it's accessible on top of the rack.\nAction: GRAB soldering_iron_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Soldering Iron\n8. Thought: I have the soldering_iron_1 needed for repair and am currently in Equipment Storage & Lounge. The apollo_twin_x_1 is located in Main Control Room on producers_desk_1. To repair it, I need to move to its location first.\n\nAction: GOTO main_control_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Control Room\n9. Thought: I am in the Main Control Room holding the soldering_iron_1 with repair ability. The broken apollo_twin_x_1 is located on producers_desk_1 in this room. To repair it, I need to approach the device first since repair actions require proximity to the target object.\n\nAction: GOTO apollo_twin_x_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Apollo Twin X Audio Interface (in Main Control Room)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires repairing the broken apollo_twin_x_1 with a soldering_iron_1, but no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet. Since I'm currently in the Equipment Storage & Lounge room, I should explore this room first to locate the necessary tools or components.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Equipment Storage & Lounge and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The apollo_twin_x_1 is not present in the current room (Equipment Storage & Lounge). Since the Main Control Room is the most likely location for audio equipment like the Apollo Twin interface, I should go there to search for it.\n\nAction: GOTO main_control_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Control Room\n3. Thought: The apollo_twin_x_1 is likely in the Main Control Room since it's audio equipment, but no objects have been discovered here yet. I need to explore this room to locate the broken device before retrieving the soldering iron.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Control Room and discovered 12 new objects\n4. Thought: The apollo_twin_x_1 is located in the Main Control Room, but the soldering_iron_1 required for repair is in the Equipment Storage & Lounge. Since I'm currently in the Main Control Room, I need to move to the Equipment Storage & Lounge to retrieve the soldering iron.\nAction: GOTO equipment_storage_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Equipment Storage & Lounge\n5. Thought: I have successfully moved to the Equipment Storage & Lounge where the soldering_iron_1 is located. To repair the apollo_twin_x_1, I first need to acquire the soldering iron since it provides the repair ability. The soldering_iron_1 is currently on top of the steel_rack_1 and accessible without opening the container.\n\nAction: GRAB soldering_iron_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Soldering Iron before grabbing\n6. Thought: The GRAB action failed because I must approach the soldering_iron_1 first. Since it's located on top of steel_rack_1, I need to move to that furniture before attempting to grab the tool.\nAction: GOTO steel_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Industrial Rack (in Equipment Storage & Lounge)\n7. Thought: I have successfully approached the Industrial Rack where the soldering_iron_1 is located. Now I can grab it directly since it's accessible on top of the rack.\nAction: GRAB soldering_iron_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Soldering Iron\n8. Thought: I have the soldering_iron_1 needed for repair and am currently in Equipment Storage & Lounge. The apollo_twin_x_1 is located in Main Control Room on producers_desk_1. To repair it, I need to move to its location first.\n\nAction: GOTO main_control_room\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Control Room\n9. Thought: I am in the Main Control Room holding the soldering_iron_1 with repair ability. The broken apollo_twin_x_1 is located on producers_desk_1 in this room. To repair it, I need to approach the device first since repair actions require proximity to the target object.\n\nAction: GOTO apollo_twin_x_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Apollo Twin X Audio Interface (in Main Control Room)\n10. Thought: I am currently holding the soldering_iron_1 which provides the repair ability, and I have successfully approached the broken apollo_twin_x_1. Since I have the required tool and am in proximity to the target object, I can now perform the repair action directly.\n\nAction: REPAIR apollo_twin_x_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed repair on Apollo Twin X Audio Interface, is_broken changed from True to False\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
