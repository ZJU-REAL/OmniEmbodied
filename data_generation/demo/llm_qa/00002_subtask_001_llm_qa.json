Since the Editor's Glass Office is a likely location for such an award, I should move there to search for it.\nAction: GOTO editors_office\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Editor's Glass Office\n3. Thought: The pulitzer_prize_1 is not discovered in the current room (Editor's Glass Office). Since this is a likely location for such an award, I need to explore this room to find it before proceeding with the task.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Editor's Glass Office and discovered 5 new objects\n4. Thought: The pulitzer_prize_1 is still not found in the current room (Editor's Glass Office). Since the Main Newsroom Floor is a common area for displaying awards and hasn't been explored yet, I should move there to search for the Pulitzer Prize.\nAction: GOTO main_newsroom\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Main Newsroom Floor\n5. Thought: The Pulitzer Prize is not found in the Break Room or Editor's Office. Since the Main Newsroom Floor is a central area where awards might be displayed, I need to explore this room to locate pulitzer_prize_1 before proceeding.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Main Newsroom Floor and discovered 15 new objects\n6. Thought: The pulitzer_prize_1 has been discovered in the Main Newsroom Floor. Since it needs to be placed on bulletin_board_1 which is in the Break Room, I should first grab the Pulitzer Prize here before moving to the Break Room.\nAction: GRAB pulitzer_prize_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Framed Pulitzer Prize before grabbing\n7.
