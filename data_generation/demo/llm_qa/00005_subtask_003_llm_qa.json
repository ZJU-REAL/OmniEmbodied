Thought: The task requires plugging in a black network router on a server rack array. Since the current room (break_room_archive_nook) is a break room and unlikely to contain technical equipment, I need to locate the server rack. The Technical Workstation Bay (type: technical) is the most probable location for server equipment. However, no objects have been discovered in any rooms yet, so I must first explore the Technical Workstation Bay to find the router and server rack.\n\nAction: GOTO technical_workstation_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Technical Workstation Bay\n2. Thought: The agent has moved to the Technical Workstation Bay, which is the most likely location for the server rack array and black network router. However, no objects are currently discovered in this room. To locate the router and server rack, exploration of the current room is required first.\n\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Technical Workstation Bay and discovered 9 new objects\n3. Thought: The exploration revealed the server rack array with the black network router on top. The router's current state is unplugged, so I need to move to the server rack array to access and plug in the router.\n\nAction: GOTO server_rack_array_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Server Rack Array (in Technical Workstation Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
