I need to explore other rooms to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO race_car_service_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Race Car Service Bay\n3. Thought: The current room (Race Car Service Bay) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and 2-inch brush).\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Race Car Service Bay and discovered 26 new objects\n4. Thought: The required painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and paint brush) have been found on the workbench in the Race Car Service Bay. I need to first grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Paint Brush before grabbing\n5. Thought: The paint brush is on the workbench, so I need to go to the workbench first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n7. Thought: I have the paint brush and need to get the red Rust-Oleum paint from the workbench to paint the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the paint brush but need to pick up the red Rust-Oleum paint can to paint the damaged front wing. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down first.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n9. Thought: Now that the paint brush has been placed back on the workbench, I can grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n10. Thought: I now have the red Rust-Oleum paint can and need to paint the damaged front wing. First, I need to go to the tire cart where the damaged front wing is located.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n11. Thought: I am now at the tire cart with the red Rust-Oleum paint can in hand. The damaged front wing is on the tire cart, so I can proceed to paint it using the paint can I'm holding.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Damaged Front Wing\n12. Thought: The paint can has been placed on the damaged front wing, but the task requires using both the paint and the brush. I need to go back to the workbench to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

I need to explore other rooms to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO race_car_service_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Race Car Service Bay\n3. Thought: The current room (Race Car Service Bay) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and 2-inch brush).\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Race Car Service Bay and discovered 26 new objects\n4. Thought: The required painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and paint brush) have been found on the workbench in the Race Car Service Bay. I need to first grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Paint Brush before grabbing\n5. Thought: The paint brush is on the workbench, so I need to go to the workbench first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n7. Thought: I have the paint brush and need to get the red Rust-Oleum paint from the workbench to paint the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the paint brush but need to pick up the red Rust-Oleum paint can to paint the damaged front wing. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down first.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n9. Thought: Now that the paint brush has been placed back on the workbench, I can grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n10. Thought: I now have the red Rust-Oleum paint can and need to paint the damaged front wing. First, I need to go to the tire cart where the damaged front wing is located.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n11. Thought: I am now at the tire cart with the red Rust-Oleum paint can in hand. The damaged front wing is on the tire cart, so I can proceed to paint it using the paint can I'm holding.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Damaged Front Wing\n12. Thought: The paint can has been placed on the damaged front wing, but the task requires using both the paint and the brush. I need to go back to the workbench to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n13. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to grab the paint brush again to complete the painting of the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the required painting materials.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Charity Logistics Station and discovered 6 new objects\n2. Thought: The current room has been explored and no painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint or 2-inch brush) were found. I need to explore other rooms to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO race_car_service_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Race Car Service Bay\n3. Thought: The current room (Race Car Service Bay) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and 2-inch brush).\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Race Car Service Bay and discovered 26 new objects\n4. Thought: The required painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and paint brush) have been found on the workbench in the Race Car Service Bay. I need to first grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Paint Brush before grabbing\n5. Thought: The paint brush is on the workbench, so I need to go to the workbench first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n7. Thought: I have the paint brush and need to get the red Rust-Oleum paint from the workbench to paint the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the paint brush but need to pick up the red Rust-Oleum paint can to paint the damaged front wing. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down first.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n9. Thought: Now that the paint brush has been placed back on the workbench, I can grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n10. Thought: I now have the red Rust-Oleum paint can and need to paint the damaged front wing. First, I need to go to the tire cart where the damaged front wing is located.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n11. Thought: I am now at the tire cart with the red Rust-Oleum paint can in hand. The damaged front wing is on the tire cart, so I can proceed to paint it using the paint can I'm holding.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Damaged Front Wing\n12. Thought: The paint can has been placed on the damaged front wing, but the task requires using both the paint and the brush. I need to go back to the workbench to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n13. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to grab the paint brush again to complete the painting of the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n14. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and need to return to the damaged front wing to complete the painting task using both the paint can (already placed on the wing) and the brush.\nAction: GOTO damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Damaged Front Wing (in Race Car Service Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The paint can has been placed on the damaged front wing, but the task requires using both the paint and the brush. I need to go back to the workbench to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n13. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to grab the paint brush again to complete the painting of the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n14. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and need to return to the damaged front wing to complete the painting task using both the paint can (already placed on the wing) and the brush.\nAction: GOTO damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Damaged Front Wing (in Race Car Service Bay)\n15.

I need to explore the current room first to find the required painting materials.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Charity Logistics Station and discovered 6 new objects\n2. Thought: The current room has been explored and no painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint or 2-inch brush) were found. I need to explore other rooms to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO race_car_service_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Race Car Service Bay\n3. Thought: The current room (Race Car Service Bay) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and 2-inch brush).\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Race Car Service Bay and discovered 26 new objects\n4. Thought: The required painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and paint brush) have been found on the workbench in the Race Car Service Bay. I need to first grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Paint Brush before grabbing\n5. Thought: The paint brush is on the workbench, so I need to go to the workbench first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n7. Thought: I have the paint brush and need to get the red Rust-Oleum paint from the workbench to paint the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the paint brush but need to pick up the red Rust-Oleum paint can to paint the damaged front wing. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down first.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n9. Thought: Now that the paint brush has been placed back on the workbench, I can grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n10. Thought: I now have the red Rust-Oleum paint can and need to paint the damaged front wing. First, I need to go to the tire cart where the damaged front wing is located.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n11. Thought: I am now at the tire cart with the red Rust-Oleum paint can in hand. The damaged front wing is on the tire cart, so I can proceed to paint it using the paint can I'm holding.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Damaged Front Wing\n12. Thought: The paint can has been placed on the damaged front wing, but the task requires using both the paint and the brush. I need to go back to the workbench to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n13. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to grab the paint brush again to complete the painting of the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n14. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and need to return to the damaged front wing to complete the painting task using both the paint can (already placed on the wing) and the brush.\nAction: GOTO damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Damaged Front Wing (in Race Car Service Bay)\n15. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and the paint can is already placed on the damaged front wing. I can now proceed to paint the damaged front wing using both items.\nAction: PAINT damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support paint operation (missing is_painted attribute)\n16. Thought: The damaged front wing needs to be painted, but the PAINT action failed because the object doesn't support the operation. I should check if the paint can needs to be opened first before painting.\nAction: OPEN paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the required painting materials.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Charity Logistics Station and discovered 6 new objects\n2. Thought: The current room has been explored and no painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint or 2-inch brush) were found. I need to explore other rooms to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO race_car_service_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Race Car Service Bay\n3. Thought: The current room (Race Car Service Bay) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and 2-inch brush).\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Race Car Service Bay and discovered 26 new objects\n4. Thought: The required painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and paint brush) have been found on the workbench in the Race Car Service Bay. I need to first grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Paint Brush before grabbing\n5. Thought: The paint brush is on the workbench, so I need to go to the workbench first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n7. Thought: I have the paint brush and need to get the red Rust-Oleum paint from the workbench to paint the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the paint brush but need to pick up the red Rust-Oleum paint can to paint the damaged front wing. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down first.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n9. Thought: Now that the paint brush has been placed back on the workbench, I can grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n10. Thought: I now have the red Rust-Oleum paint can and need to paint the damaged front wing. First, I need to go to the tire cart where the damaged front wing is located.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n11. Thought: I am now at the tire cart with the red Rust-Oleum paint can in hand. The damaged front wing is on the tire cart, so I can proceed to paint it using the paint can I'm holding.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Damaged Front Wing\n12. Thought: The paint can has been placed on the damaged front wing, but the task requires using both the paint and the brush. I need to go back to the workbench to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n13. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to grab the paint brush again to complete the painting of the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n14. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and need to return to the damaged front wing to complete the painting task using both the paint can (already placed on the wing) and the brush.\nAction: GOTO damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Damaged Front Wing (in Race Car Service Bay)\n15. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and the paint can is already placed on the damaged front wing. I can now proceed to paint the damaged front wing using both items.\nAction: PAINT damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support paint operation (missing is_painted attribute)\n16. Thought: The damaged front wing needs to be painted, but the PAINT action failed because the object doesn't support the operation. I should check if the paint can needs to be opened first before painting.\nAction: OPEN paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n17. Thought: The paint can doesn't support the OPEN operation, but I have both the paint brush and paint can ready. I should try using the paint brush on the damaged front wing directly since the paint can is already placed on it.\nAction: PAINT damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support paint operation (missing is_painted attribute)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the required painting materials.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Charity Logistics Station and discovered 6 new objects\n2. Thought: The current room has been explored and no painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint or 2-inch brush) were found. I need to explore other rooms to locate these items.\nAction: GOTO race_car_service_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Race Car Service Bay\n3. Thought: The current room (Race Car Service Bay) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and 2-inch brush).\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Race Car Service Bay and discovered 26 new objects\n4. Thought: The required painting materials (red Rust-Oleum paint and paint brush) have been found on the workbench in the Race Car Service Bay. I need to first grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Paint Brush before grabbing\n5. Thought: The paint brush is on the workbench, so I need to go to the workbench first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I can grab the paint brush to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n7. Thought: I have the paint brush and need to get the red Rust-Oleum paint from the workbench to paint the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n8. Thought: I currently have the paint brush but need to pick up the red Rust-Oleum paint can to paint the damaged front wing. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down first.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n9. Thought: Now that the paint brush has been placed back on the workbench, I can grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n10. Thought: I now have the red Rust-Oleum paint can and need to paint the damaged front wing. First, I need to go to the tire cart where the damaged front wing is located.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n11. Thought: I am now at the tire cart with the red Rust-Oleum paint can in hand. The damaged front wing is on the tire cart, so I can proceed to paint it using the paint can I'm holding.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Damaged Front Wing\n12. Thought: The paint can has been placed on the damaged front wing, but the task requires using both the paint and the brush. I need to go back to the workbench to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n13. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to grab the paint brush again to complete the painting of the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n14. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and need to return to the damaged front wing to complete the painting task using both the paint can (already placed on the wing) and the brush.\nAction: GOTO damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Damaged Front Wing (in Race Car Service Bay)\n15. Thought: I now have the paint brush in hand and the paint can is already placed on the damaged front wing. I can now proceed to paint the damaged front wing using both items.\nAction: PAINT damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support paint operation (missing is_painted attribute)\n16. Thought: The damaged front wing needs to be painted, but the PAINT action failed because the object doesn't support the operation. I should check if the paint can needs to be opened first before painting.\nAction: OPEN paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n17. Thought: The paint can doesn't support the OPEN operation, but I have both the paint brush and paint can ready. I should try using the paint brush on the damaged front wing directly since the paint can is already placed on it.\nAction: PAINT damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support paint operation (missing is_painted attribute)\n18. Thought: The PAINT action keeps failing because the damaged front wing doesn't have the required attribute. Since I have both the paint brush and paint can ready, I should try placing the paint brush on the damaged front wing to complete the task.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on damaged_front_wing_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Damaged Front Wing\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
