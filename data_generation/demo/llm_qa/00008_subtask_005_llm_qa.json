Thought: The task requires repairing a satellite phone using a toolbox, but no objects have been discovered yet. I need to explore the current room first to find the necessary items.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The satellite phone is on the planning table and needs repair. I need to check if the toolbox is available in the current room or if I need to explore other rooms. Since the current room has been explored and no toolbox is found, I should check other rooms starting with the most likely one - the Logistics & Supply Depot.\nAction: GOTO logistics_depot\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Logistics & Supply Depot\n3. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in the current room (Logistics & Supply Depot). I need to explore this room to locate the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Logistics & Supply Depot and discovered 8 new objects\n4. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Logistics & Supply Depot. I need to check other rooms for the toolbox, starting with the Medical Triage & Storage room as it might contain medical tools that could include a toolbox.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n5. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Logistics & Supply Depot). I need to explore the current room (Medical Triage & Storage) to check for the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n6. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Logistics & Supply Depot, Medical Triage & Storage). I need to check the remaining rooms (Communications & Tech Corner, Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area) for the toolbox, starting with the most likely one - the Communications & Tech Corner.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n7. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to check for the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n8. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms. The remaining unexplored rooms are Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and Staff Break Area. I should check the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint next as it might contain confiscated items like the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n9. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms. The only remaining unexplored room is the Staff Break Area. I should check there next as it might contain the confiscated toolbox.\nAction: GOTO staff_break\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Staff Break Area\n10. Thought: The toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms. The only remaining option is to explore the current room (Staff Break Area) to check for the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Staff Break Area and discovered 9 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
