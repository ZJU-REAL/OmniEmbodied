Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the coffee-stained duty roster and the bulletin board.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far.

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the coffee-stained duty roster and the bulletin board.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far. I need to explore the current room (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n12. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the Guard Desk. Now I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Coffee-Stained Duty Roster (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far. I need to explore the current room (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n12. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the Guard Desk. Now I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Coffee-Stained Duty Roster (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n13.

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the coffee-stained duty roster and the bulletin board.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far. I need to explore the current room (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n12. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the Guard Desk. Now I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Coffee-Stained Duty Roster (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n13. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been located on the guard desk in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. Now I need to pick it up and take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GRAB duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Coffee-Stained Duty Roster\n14.

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the coffee-stained duty roster and the bulletin board.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far. I need to explore the current room (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n12. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the Guard Desk. Now I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Coffee-Stained Duty Roster (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n13. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been located on the guard desk in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. Now I need to pick it up and take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GRAB duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Coffee-Stained Duty Roster\n14. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is now in my inventory. I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Central Operations Room，再靠近Bulletin Board\n15. Thought: The bulletin board is located in the Central Operations Room, but I am currently in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. I need to go to the Central Operations Room first before approaching the bulletin board.\nAction: GOTO central_operations\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Central Operations Room\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the coffee-stained duty roster and the bulletin board.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far. I need to explore the current room (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n12. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the Guard Desk. Now I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Coffee-Stained Duty Roster (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n13. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been located on the guard desk in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. Now I need to pick it up and take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GRAB duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Coffee-Stained Duty Roster\n14. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is now in my inventory. I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Central Operations Room，再靠近Bulletin Board\n15. Thought: The bulletin board is located in the Central Operations Room, but I am currently in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. I need to go to the Central Operations Room first before approaching the bulletin board.\nAction: GOTO central_operations\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Central Operations Room\n16. Thought: Now that I'm in the Central Operations Room with the coffee-stained duty roster in my inventory, I need to place it on the bulletin board.\nAction: PLACE duty_roster_1 on bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach bulletin_board_1 before placing object\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the coffee-stained duty roster and the bulletin board.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far. I need to explore the current room (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n12. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the Guard Desk. Now I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Coffee-Stained Duty Roster (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n13. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been located on the guard desk in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. Now I need to pick it up and take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GRAB duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Coffee-Stained Duty Roster\n14. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is now in my inventory. I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Central Operations Room，再靠近Bulletin Board\n15. Thought: The bulletin board is located in the Central Operations Room, but I am currently in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. I need to go to the Central Operations Room first before approaching the bulletin board.\nAction: GOTO central_operations\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Central Operations Room\n16. Thought: Now that I'm in the Central Operations Room with the coffee-stained duty roster in my inventory, I need to place it on the bulletin board.\nAction: PLACE duty_roster_1 on bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach bulletin_board_1 before placing object\n17. Thought: I need to approach the bulletin board first before placing the coffee-stained duty roster on it.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bulletin Board (in Central Operations Room)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: No objects have been found in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the coffee-stained duty roster and the bulletin board.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not listed among the discovered objects in the Central Operations Room. I need to check if it might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack or the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests, as these are the only containers or stacks that might contain it.\nAction: GOTO medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack (in Central Operations Room)\n3. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster might be inside the Bloodied Field Medic’s Backpack since it is unzipped and has gauze spilling out, indicating it might contain other items. I should check inside it.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n4. Thought: Since the coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, I should check the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests next as it might contain the roster.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n5. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack, and the Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests might contain it. I should check the stack to see if the roster is there.\nAction: GOTO supply_manifests_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Leaning Stack of Supply Manifests (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is not found in the backpack or the stack of manifests. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, it might not be in the current room. I should check other rooms for the roster.\nAction: GOTO medical_triage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Medical Triage & Storage\n7. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster was not found in the Central Operations Room. Since I'm now in the Medical Triage & Storage room, I should explore this room to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Medical Triage & Storage and discovered 8 new objects\n8. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in either the Central Operations Room or the Medical Triage & Storage room. Since it's not listed among the discovered objects in these rooms, I should check the remaining rooms to locate it.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n9. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Medical Triage & Storage. I need to explore the current room (Communications & Tech Corner) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Communications & Tech Corner and discovered 3 new objects\n10. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Medical Triage & Storage, and Communications & Tech Corner). Since it's not listed among the discovered objects, I should check the remaining rooms (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint, Staff Break Area, and Logistics & Supply Depot) to locate it.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n11. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has not been found in any of the explored rooms so far. I need to explore the current room (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint) to see if the roster is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n12. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the Guard Desk. Now I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Coffee-Stained Duty Roster (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n13. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster has been located on the guard desk in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. Now I need to pick it up and take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GRAB duty_roster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Coffee-Stained Duty Roster\n14. Thought: The coffee-stained duty roster is now in my inventory. I need to take it to the bulletin board in the Central Operations Room.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 请先前往Central Operations Room，再靠近Bulletin Board\n15. Thought: The bulletin board is located in the Central Operations Room, but I am currently in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. I need to go to the Central Operations Room first before approaching the bulletin board.\nAction: GOTO central_operations\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Central Operations Room\n16. Thought: Now that I'm in the Central Operations Room with the coffee-stained duty roster in my inventory, I need to place it on the bulletin board.\nAction: PLACE duty_roster_1 on bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach bulletin_board_1 before placing object\n17. Thought: I need to approach the bulletin board first before placing the coffee-stained duty roster on it.\nAction: GOTO bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Bulletin Board (in Central Operations Room)\n18. Thought: Now that I'm near the bulletin board with the coffee-stained duty roster in my inventory, I can place it on the bulletin board to complete the task.\nAction: PLACE duty_roster_1 on bulletin_board_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Coffee-Stained Duty Roster on Bulletin Board\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
