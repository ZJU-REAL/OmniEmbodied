The next likely container is the document safe, but it's locked and I don't have the ability to unlock it. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table for the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Large Wooden Planning Table (in Central Operations Room)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

I need to explore the current room first to find the necessary items.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The radio transceiver is broken, but the task mentions repairing a \"radio handset\" which isn't listed among the discovered objects. I need to check if the handset might be inside the radio transceiver or another container.\nAction: OPEN radio_transceiver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n3. Thought: The radio transceiver doesn't support opening, so the handset must be elsewhere.

Thought: The planning table is now open, and it contains several objects including a satellite phone and a medic backpack. Since the radio handset isn't visible in the room, it might be inside one of these containers. I should check the medic backpack first as it's more likely to contain tools or small items.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n5. Thought: The medic backpack doesn't support opening, but it has a zipper that can be closed. Since the task mentions using a toolbox to repair the radio handset, I should look for the toolbox in other containers or objects in the room. The next likely container is the document safe, but it's locked and I don't have the ability to unlock it. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table for the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Large Wooden Planning Table (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found yet among the visible objects.

Thought: The task requires repairing a broken radio handset using a toolbox, but no objects have been discovered yet. I need to explore the current room first to find the necessary items.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The radio transceiver is broken, but the task mentions repairing a \"radio handset\" which isn't listed among the discovered objects. I need to check if the handset might be inside the radio transceiver or another container.\nAction: OPEN radio_transceiver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n3. Thought: The radio transceiver doesn't support opening, so the handset must be elsewhere. I should check other containers in the room, starting with the planning table which is a container and currently closed.\nAction: OPEN planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Large Wooden Planning Table, is_open changed from False to True\n4. Thought: The planning table is now open, and it contains several objects including a satellite phone and a medic backpack. Since the radio handset isn't visible in the room, it might be inside one of these containers. I should check the medic backpack first as it's more likely to contain tools or small items.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n5. Thought: The medic backpack doesn't support opening, but it has a zipper that can be closed. Since the task mentions using a toolbox to repair the radio handset, I should look for the toolbox in other containers or objects in the room. The next likely container is the document safe, but it's locked and I don't have the ability to unlock it. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table for the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Large Wooden Planning Table (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found yet among the visible objects. Since the document safe is locked and I can't open it, I should check the remaining objects on the planning table (satellite phone, coffee pot, supply manifests) to see if any of them might contain or be the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO satellite_phone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Satellite Phone (in Central Operations Room)\n7. Thought: The satellite phone is not a container and doesn't appear to be the toolbox needed for the repair. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table (coffee pot and supply manifests) to see if they might contain or be the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO coffee_pot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Stale Pot of Coffee (in Central Operations Room)\n8. Thought: The coffee pot is not a container and doesn't appear to be the toolbox needed for the repair. The last object on the planning table is the stack of supply manifests, which also doesn't seem to be the toolbox. Since the toolbox hasn't been found in the current room, I should check other rooms, starting with the Logistics & Supply Depot which is likely to contain tools and supplies.\nAction: GOTO logistics_depot\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Logistics & Supply Depot\n9. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found in the Central Operations Room. Since the task mentions a \"confiscated toolbox,\" it might be in the Logistics & Supply Depot.

Thought: The task requires repairing a broken radio handset using a toolbox, but no objects have been discovered yet. I need to explore the current room first to find the necessary items.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The radio transceiver is broken, but the task mentions repairing a \"radio handset\" which isn't listed among the discovered objects. I need to check if the handset might be inside the radio transceiver or another container.\nAction: OPEN radio_transceiver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n3. Thought: The radio transceiver doesn't support opening, so the handset must be elsewhere. I should check other containers in the room, starting with the planning table which is a container and currently closed.\nAction: OPEN planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Large Wooden Planning Table, is_open changed from False to True\n4. Thought: The planning table is now open, and it contains several objects including a satellite phone and a medic backpack. Since the radio handset isn't visible in the room, it might be inside one of these containers. I should check the medic backpack first as it's more likely to contain tools or small items.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n5. Thought: The medic backpack doesn't support opening, but it has a zipper that can be closed. Since the task mentions using a toolbox to repair the radio handset, I should look for the toolbox in other containers or objects in the room. The next likely container is the document safe, but it's locked and I don't have the ability to unlock it. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table for the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Large Wooden Planning Table (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found yet among the visible objects. Since the document safe is locked and I can't open it, I should check the remaining objects on the planning table (satellite phone, coffee pot, supply manifests) to see if any of them might contain or be the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO satellite_phone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Satellite Phone (in Central Operations Room)\n7. Thought: The satellite phone is not a container and doesn't appear to be the toolbox needed for the repair. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table (coffee pot and supply manifests) to see if they might contain or be the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO coffee_pot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Stale Pot of Coffee (in Central Operations Room)\n8. Thought: The coffee pot is not a container and doesn't appear to be the toolbox needed for the repair. The last object on the planning table is the stack of supply manifests, which also doesn't seem to be the toolbox. Since the toolbox hasn't been found in the current room, I should check other rooms, starting with the Logistics & Supply Depot which is likely to contain tools and supplies.\nAction: GOTO logistics_depot\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Logistics & Supply Depot\n9. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found in the Central Operations Room. Since the task mentions a \"confiscated toolbox,\" it might be in the Logistics & Supply Depot. I need to explore this room to find the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Logistics & Supply Depot and discovered 8 new objects\n10. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found in the Central Operations Room, and the Logistics & Supply Depot has been explored. None of the discovered objects match the description of a toolbox. Since the task requires a toolbox to repair the radio handset, I should check if any of the objects in the Logistics & Supply Depot can serve as a substitute for the toolbox or if they contain tools that can be used for repair.\nAction: GOTO generator_parts_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Generator Parts (in Logistics & Supply Depot)\n11. Thought: The generator parts might contain tools that could be used for repairing the radio handset. I should check if they can be used as a substitute for the toolbox.\nAction: GRAB generator_parts_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Generator Parts\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

I need to explore the current room first to find the necessary items.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Central Operations Room and discovered 9 new objects\n2. Thought: The radio transceiver is broken, but the task mentions repairing a \"radio handset\" which isn't listed among the discovered objects. I need to check if the handset might be inside the radio transceiver or another container.\nAction: OPEN radio_transceiver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n3. Thought: The radio transceiver doesn't support opening, so the handset must be elsewhere. I should check other containers in the room, starting with the planning table which is a container and currently closed.\nAction: OPEN planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed open on Large Wooden Planning Table, is_open changed from False to True\n4. Thought: The planning table is now open, and it contains several objects including a satellite phone and a medic backpack. Since the radio handset isn't visible in the room, it might be inside one of these containers. I should check the medic backpack first as it's more likely to contain tools or small items.\nAction: OPEN medic_backpack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support open operation (missing is_open attribute)\n5. Thought: The medic backpack doesn't support opening, but it has a zipper that can be closed. Since the task mentions using a toolbox to repair the radio handset, I should look for the toolbox in other containers or objects in the room. The next likely container is the document safe, but it's locked and I don't have the ability to unlock it. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table for the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Large Wooden Planning Table (in Central Operations Room)\n6. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found yet among the visible objects. Since the document safe is locked and I can't open it, I should check the remaining objects on the planning table (satellite phone, coffee pot, supply manifests) to see if any of them might contain or be the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO satellite_phone_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Satellite Phone (in Central Operations Room)\n7. Thought: The satellite phone is not a container and doesn't appear to be the toolbox needed for the repair. I should check the remaining objects on the planning table (coffee pot and supply manifests) to see if they might contain or be the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO coffee_pot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Stale Pot of Coffee (in Central Operations Room)\n8. Thought: The coffee pot is not a container and doesn't appear to be the toolbox needed for the repair. The last object on the planning table is the stack of supply manifests, which also doesn't seem to be the toolbox. Since the toolbox hasn't been found in the current room, I should check other rooms, starting with the Logistics & Supply Depot which is likely to contain tools and supplies.\nAction: GOTO logistics_depot\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Logistics & Supply Depot\n9. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found in the Central Operations Room. Since the task mentions a \"confiscated toolbox,\" it might be in the Logistics & Supply Depot. I need to explore this room to find the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Logistics & Supply Depot and discovered 8 new objects\n10. Thought: The toolbox hasn't been found in the Central Operations Room, and the Logistics & Supply Depot has been explored. None of the discovered objects match the description of a toolbox. Since the task requires a toolbox to repair the radio handset, I should check if any of the objects in the Logistics & Supply Depot can serve as a substitute for the toolbox or if they contain tools that can be used for repair.\nAction: GOTO generator_parts_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Generator Parts (in Logistics & Supply Depot)\n11. Thought: The generator parts might contain tools that could be used for repairing the radio handset. I should check if they can be used as a substitute for the toolbox.\nAction: GRAB generator_parts_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Generator Parts\n12. Thought: The generator parts have been grabbed, but they may not be sufficient for repairing the radio handset. Since the toolbox hasn't been found in either room, I should check other rooms for the toolbox, starting with the Communications & Tech Corner, which is likely to contain technical equipment.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
