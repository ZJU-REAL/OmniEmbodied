Thought: The task requires using a hex key set to carve a weapon prototype, but no objects have been discovered in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the necessary tools and prototype.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Art & Animation Bullpen and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The task requires using a hex key set to carve a weapon prototype. The plastic katana (ID: plastic_katana_1) seems to be the closest object resembling a weapon prototype in the room. I need to grab it to proceed with the carving.\nAction: GRAB plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Plastic Katana before grabbing\n3. Thought: I need to approach the plastic katana before I can grab it. I will move to the plastic katana's location first.\nAction: GOTO plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Plastic Katana (in Art & Animation Bullpen)\n4. Thought: Now that I'm near the plastic katana, I can grab it to proceed with the carving task.\nAction: GRAB plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Plastic Katana\n5. Thought: The task requires using a hex key set to carve the plastic katana, but no hex key set has been discovered in the current room. I need to explore other rooms to find the necessary tool.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Art & Animation Bullpen but found no new objects\n6. Thought: The task requires a hex key set to carve the plastic katana, but none has been found in the current room. I need to explore other rooms to locate the hex key set.\nAction: GOTO qa_testing_lab\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to QA Testing Lab\n7. Thought: The hex key set has not been found in the current room (QA Testing Lab). I need to explore this room to discover if the hex key set is present here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored QA Testing Lab and discovered 12 new objects\n8. Thought: The hex key set (ID: hex_key_set_1) has been discovered in the QA Testing Lab. I need to grab it to proceed with carving the plastic katana.\nAction: GRAB hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n9. Thought: The agent is currently holding the plastic katana and needs to grab the hex key set to perform the carving. Since the grasp capacity is full, I need to place the plastic katana down first before grabbing the hex key set.\nAction: PLACE plastic_katana_1 on multi_console_test_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach multi_console_test_rack_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: To place the plastic katana on the multi-console test rack, I need to approach it first since I'm not currently near it.\nAction: GOTO multi_console_test_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Multi-Console Test Rack (in QA Testing Lab)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the multi-console test rack, I can place the plastic katana on it to free up my grasp capacity for the hex key set.\nAction: PLACE plastic_katana_1 on multi_console_test_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Plastic Katana on Multi-Console Test Rack\n12. Thought: Now that the plastic katana has been placed on the multi-console test rack, I can proceed to grab the hex key set to perform the carving task.\nAction: GRAB hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Hex Key Set before grabbing\n13. Thought: The hex key set is in the QA Testing Lab but I'm not currently near it. I need to approach it before I can grab it.\nAction: GOTO hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Hex Key Set (in QA Testing Lab)\n14. Thought: Now that I'm near the hex key set, I can grab it to perform the carving task on the plastic katana.\nAction: GRAB hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Hex Key Set\n15. Thought: Now that I have the hex key set and the plastic katana is placed on the multi-console test rack, I need to approach the plastic katana again to perform the carving task.\nAction: GOTO plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Plastic Katana (in QA Testing Lab)\n16. Thought: Now that I have the hex key set and am near the plastic katana, I can use the hex key set to carve the plastic katana as per the task requirements.\nAction: CARVE plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support carve operation (missing is_carved attribute)\n17. Thought: The plastic katana doesn't support the carve operation, but the task requires carving a weapon prototype. I need to find another object that can be carved as a weapon prototype.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored QA Testing Lab but found no new objects\n18. Thought: The plastic katana cannot be carved, and no other weapon prototypes have been found in the current room. Since the task requires carving a weapon prototype, I need to explore other rooms to find a suitable object.\nAction: GOTO motion_capture_stage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Motion Capture Stage\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires using a hex key set to carve a weapon prototype, but no objects have been discovered in the current room. I need to explore the current room first to find the necessary tools and prototype.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Art & Animation Bullpen and discovered 11 new objects\n2. Thought: The task requires using a hex key set to carve a weapon prototype. The plastic katana (ID: plastic_katana_1) seems to be the closest object resembling a weapon prototype in the room. I need to grab it to proceed with the carving.\nAction: GRAB plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Plastic Katana before grabbing\n3. Thought: I need to approach the plastic katana before I can grab it. I will move to the plastic katana's location first.\nAction: GOTO plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Plastic Katana (in Art & Animation Bullpen)\n4. Thought: Now that I'm near the plastic katana, I can grab it to proceed with the carving task.\nAction: GRAB plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Plastic Katana\n5. Thought: The task requires using a hex key set to carve the plastic katana, but no hex key set has been discovered in the current room. I need to explore other rooms to find the necessary tool.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Art & Animation Bullpen but found no new objects\n6. Thought: The task requires a hex key set to carve the plastic katana, but none has been found in the current room. I need to explore other rooms to locate the hex key set.\nAction: GOTO qa_testing_lab\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to QA Testing Lab\n7. Thought: The hex key set has not been found in the current room (QA Testing Lab). I need to explore this room to discover if the hex key set is present here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored QA Testing Lab and discovered 12 new objects\n8. Thought: The hex key set (ID: hex_key_set_1) has been discovered in the QA Testing Lab. I need to grab it to proceed with carving the plastic katana.\nAction: GRAB hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n9. Thought: The agent is currently holding the plastic katana and needs to grab the hex key set to perform the carving. Since the grasp capacity is full, I need to place the plastic katana down first before grabbing the hex key set.\nAction: PLACE plastic_katana_1 on multi_console_test_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach multi_console_test_rack_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: To place the plastic katana on the multi-console test rack, I need to approach it first since I'm not currently near it.\nAction: GOTO multi_console_test_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Multi-Console Test Rack (in QA Testing Lab)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the multi-console test rack, I can place the plastic katana on it to free up my grasp capacity for the hex key set.\nAction: PLACE plastic_katana_1 on multi_console_test_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Plastic Katana on Multi-Console Test Rack\n12. Thought: Now that the plastic katana has been placed on the multi-console test rack, I can proceed to grab the hex key set to perform the carving task.\nAction: GRAB hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Hex Key Set before grabbing\n13. Thought: The hex key set is in the QA Testing Lab but I'm not currently near it. I need to approach it before I can grab it.\nAction: GOTO hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Hex Key Set (in QA Testing Lab)\n14. Thought: Now that I'm near the hex key set, I can grab it to perform the carving task on the plastic katana.\nAction: GRAB hex_key_set_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Hex Key Set\n15. Thought: Now that I have the hex key set and the plastic katana is placed on the multi-console test rack, I need to approach the plastic katana again to perform the carving task.\nAction: GOTO plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Plastic Katana (in QA Testing Lab)\n16. Thought: Now that I have the hex key set and am near the plastic katana, I can use the hex key set to carve the plastic katana as per the task requirements.\nAction: CARVE plastic_katana_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object does not support carve operation (missing is_carved attribute)\n17. Thought: The plastic katana doesn't support the carve operation, but the task requires carving a weapon prototype. I need to find another object that can be carved as a weapon prototype.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored QA Testing Lab but found no new objects\n18. Thought: The plastic katana cannot be carved, and no other weapon prototypes have been found in the current room. Since the task requires carving a weapon prototype, I need to explore other rooms to find a suitable object.\nAction: GOTO motion_capture_stage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Motion Capture Stage\n19. Thought: The task requires carving a weapon prototype, but no suitable objects have been found in the current room (Motion Capture Stage). I need to explore this room to discover any potential weapon prototypes that can be carved.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Motion Capture Stage and discovered 11 new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
