Thought: The task requires finding the heaviest steel motion-capture rig. Since motion-capture equipment is most likely in the Motion Capture Stage room, I need to move there first. The current room (Art & Animation Bullpen) has no discovered objects related to motion capture, so exploring here would be inefficient. I'll navigate directly to the Motion Capture Stage to begin the search.\n\nAction: GOTO motion_capture_stage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Motion Capture Stage\n2. Thought: I am currently in the Motion Capture Stage room, which is the most logical location for motion-capture rigs. Since no objects have been discovered yet in this room, I need to explore first to find potential motion-capture rigs before identifying the heaviest steel one to raise.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Motion Capture Stage and discovered 11 new objects\n3. Thought: The exploration revealed a motion-capture rig (motion_capture_rig_1) that matches the criteria: it's made of steel and weighs 85.0kg, making it the heaviest steel rig in the room. Since it's currently lowered (is_lowered: True), I need to raise it to complete the task.\nAction: RAISE motion_capture_rig_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully performed raise on Motion-capture Rig, is_lowered changed from True to False\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The task was to find the heaviest steel motion-capture rig and raise it. The exploration revealed only one motion-capture rig (motion_capture_rig_1) in the Motion Capture Stage, which is made of steel and weighs 85.0kg. The RAISE action was successfully executed, changing its state from lowered to raised. Since this is the only steel rig discovered and the task requirements are fully satisfied, the task is complete.\n\nAction: DONE",
