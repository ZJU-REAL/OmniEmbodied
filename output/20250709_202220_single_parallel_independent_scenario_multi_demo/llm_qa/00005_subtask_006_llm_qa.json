Thought: The task requires repairing a broken plastic triple-monitor workstation using a repair kit. However, no objects have been found in any of the rooms, and the two robots are in the Break Room & Archive Nook with no items or abilities. The next step is to explore the rooms to locate the repair kit and the workstation.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1彻底探索了Break Room & Archive Nook，发现了15个新物体\n2. Thought: The exploration of the Break Room & Archive Nook has revealed multiple objects, including a microwave and mini-fridge combo, filing cabinets, a circular meeting table, a hidden safe, a broken coffee machine, a whiteboard, and a toaster. However, the task requires repairing a broken plastic triple-monitor workstation using a repair kit, which has not been identified yet. The next step is to search for the triple-monitor workstation and the repair kit in the current room or other rooms.  \nAction: SEARCH_FOR_OBJECT \"triple-monitor workstation\"\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: SEARCH_FOR_OBJECT\n3. Thought: The previous attempt to search for the \"triple-monitor workstation\" was invalid. I need to explore other rooms to locate the triple-monitor workstation and the repair kit.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1探索了Break Room & Archive Nook，但没有发现新物体\n4. Thought: The exploration of the Break Room & Archive Nook has already been completed, and no new objects were found. The task requires locating a broken plastic triple-monitor workstation and a repair kit. Since the workstation and repair kit have not been identified yet, I need to explore other rooms to find them.  \nAction: EXPLORE room:Storage & Logistics Corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 命令格式错误: EXPLORE room:Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The previous attempt to explore the \"Storage & Logistics Corner\" was invalid due to incorrect command formatting. The correct action is to explore the room using the \"EXPLORE\" command without specifying the room name in the format. I will now explore the \"Storage & Logistics Corner\" correctly.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1探索了Break Room & Archive Nook，但没有发现新物体\n6. Thought: The exploration of the Break Room & Archive Nook has already been completed, and no new objects were found. The task requires locating a broken plastic triple-monitor workstation and a repair kit. Since the workstation and repair kit have not been identified yet, I need to explore the remaining rooms to find them.  \nAction: EXPLORE room:Main Command Hub\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 命令格式错误: EXPLORE room:Main Command Hub\n7. Thought: The previous attempts to explore other rooms were invalid due to incorrect command formatting. The correct approach is to use the \"EXPLORE\" command without specifying the room name in the format. I will now explore the \"Main Command Hub\" correctly.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1探索了Break Room & Archive Nook，但没有发现新物体\n8.

Thought: The task requires repairing a broken plastic triple-monitor workstation using a repair kit. However, no objects have been found in any of the rooms, and the two robots are in the Break Room & Archive Nook with no items or abilities. The next step is to explore the rooms to locate the repair kit and the workstation.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1彻底探索了Break Room & Archive Nook，发现了15个新物体\n2. Thought: The exploration of the Break Room & Archive Nook has revealed multiple objects, including a microwave and mini-fridge combo, filing cabinets, a circular meeting table, a hidden safe, a broken coffee machine, a whiteboard, and a toaster. However, the task requires repairing a broken plastic triple-monitor workstation using a repair kit, which has not been identified yet. The next step is to search for the triple-monitor workstation and the repair kit in the current room or other rooms.  \nAction: SEARCH_FOR_OBJECT \"triple-monitor workstation\"\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: SEARCH_FOR_OBJECT\n3.

Since the workstation and repair kit have not been identified yet, I need to explore other rooms to find them.  \nAction: EXPLORE room:Storage & Logistics Corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 命令格式错误: EXPLORE room:Storage & Logistics Corner\n5. Thought: The previous attempt to explore the \"Storage & Logistics Corner\" was invalid due to incorrect command formatting. The correct action is to explore the room using the \"EXPLORE\" command without specifying the room name in the format. I will now explore the \"Storage & Logistics Corner\" correctly.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1探索了Break Room & Archive Nook，但没有发现新物体\n6.

Thought: The task requires repairing a broken plastic triple-monitor workstation using a repair kit. However, no objects have been found in any of the rooms, and the two robots are in the Break Room & Archive Nook with no items or abilities. The next step is to explore the rooms to locate the repair kit and the workstation.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1彻底探索了Break Room & Archive Nook，发现了15个新物体\n2. Thought: The exploration of the Break Room & Archive Nook has revealed multiple objects, including a microwave and mini-fridge combo, filing cabinets, a circular meeting table, a hidden safe, a broken coffee machine, a whiteboard, and a toaster.
