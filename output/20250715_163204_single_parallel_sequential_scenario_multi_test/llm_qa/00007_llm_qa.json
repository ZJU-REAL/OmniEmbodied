Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2.

Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box, I need to grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside it.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n3. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the Utility Knife with the 'spread' ability, I can return to the Intake Bay to open the Empty Gaylord Box and retrieve the yellow rubber boot.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2.

Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the Utility Knife with the 'spread' ability, I can return to the Intake Bay to open the Empty Gaylord Box and retrieve the yellow rubber boot.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I'm back in the Intake Bay with the Utility Knife, I need to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) so I can access the yellow rubber boot inside.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n10. Thought: I need to use the 'spread' ability provided by the Utility Knife (knife_1) that I'm holding to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). Since the knife provides the ability, I should attempt to open the box directly.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n11. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) first before attempting to use the Utility Knife to open it.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) with the Utility Knife (knife_1) that has the 'spread' ability, I should use it to open the box so I can access the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box, I need to grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside it.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n3. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the Utility Knife with the 'spread' ability, I can return to the Intake Bay to open the Empty Gaylord Box and retrieve the yellow rubber boot.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I'm back in the Intake Bay with the Utility Knife, I need to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) so I can access the yellow rubber boot inside.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n10. Thought: I need to use the 'spread' ability provided by the Utility Knife (knife_1) that I'm holding to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). Since the knife provides the ability, I should attempt to open the box directly.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n11. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) first before attempting to use the Utility Knife to open it.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) with the Utility Knife (knife_1) that has the 'spread' ability, I should use it to open the box so I can access the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The Utility Knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, which should have opened it. Now I can grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside the box.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
        "output": "Thought: The Empty Gaylord Box remains closed despite placing the Utility Knife on it. I need to find another way to open the box or retrieve the yellow rubber boot. Since the Steel Crowbar inside the box provides the 'assemble' ability, I might need to find another tool outside the box that can help open it.

Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box, I need to grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside it.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n3. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the Utility Knife with the 'spread' ability, I can return to the Intake Bay to open the Empty Gaylord Box and retrieve the yellow rubber boot.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I'm back in the Intake Bay with the Utility Knife, I need to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) so I can access the yellow rubber boot inside.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n10. Thought: I need to use the 'spread' ability provided by the Utility Knife (knife_1) that I'm holding to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). Since the knife provides the ability, I should attempt to open the box directly.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n11. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) first before attempting to use the Utility Knife to open it.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) with the Utility Knife (knife_1) that has the 'spread' ability, I should use it to open the box so I can access the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The Utility Knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, which should have opened it. Now I can grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside the box.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n14. Thought: The Empty Gaylord Box remains closed despite placing the Utility Knife on it. I need to find another way to open the box or retrieve the yellow rubber boot. Since the Steel Crowbar inside the box provides the 'assemble' ability, I might need to find another tool outside the box that can help open it. Looking back at the Sorting Floor, there's a Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) that provides the 'screw' ability, which might be useful for opening the box.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2.

I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the Utility Knife with the 'spread' ability, I can return to the Intake Bay to open the Empty Gaylord Box and retrieve the yellow rubber boot.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I'm back in the Intake Bay with the Utility Knife, I need to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) so I can access the yellow rubber boot inside.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n10. Thought: I need to use the 'spread' ability provided by the Utility Knife (knife_1) that I'm holding to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). Since the knife provides the ability, I should attempt to open the box directly.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n11. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) first before attempting to use the Utility Knife to open it.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) with the Utility Knife (knife_1) that has the 'spread' ability, I should use it to open the box so I can access the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The Utility Knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, which should have opened it. Now I can grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside the box.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n14. Thought: The Empty Gaylord Box remains closed despite placing the Utility Knife on it. I need to find another way to open the box or retrieve the yellow rubber boot. Since the Steel Crowbar inside the box provides the 'assemble' ability, I might need to find another tool outside the box that can help open it. Looking back at the Sorting Floor, there's a Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) that provides the 'screw' ability, which might be useful for opening the box.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n15. Thought: The Utility Knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. Now I need to try using the Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) from the Sorting Floor, which provides the 'screw' ability, to open the box. First, I need to locate and grab the screwdriver.\n\nAction: GOTO screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Phillips Screwdriver (in Sorting Floor)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6.

Thought: The Empty Gaylord Box remains closed despite placing the Utility Knife on it. I need to find another way to open the box or retrieve the yellow rubber boot. Since the Steel Crowbar inside the box provides the 'assemble' ability, I might need to find another tool outside the box that can help open it.

Thought: The Utility Knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. Now I need to try using the Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) from the Sorting Floor, which provides the 'screw' ability, to open the box. First, I need to locate and grab the screwdriver.\n\nAction: GOTO screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Phillips Screwdriver (in Sorting Floor)\n16.

Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2.

I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the Utility Knife with the 'spread' ability, I can return to the Intake Bay to open the Empty Gaylord Box and retrieve the yellow rubber boot.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I'm back in the Intake Bay with the Utility Knife, I need to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) so I can access the yellow rubber boot inside.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n10. Thought: I need to use the 'spread' ability provided by the Utility Knife (knife_1) that I'm holding to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). Since the knife provides the ability, I should attempt to open the box directly.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n11. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) first before attempting to use the Utility Knife to open it.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) with the Utility Knife (knife_1) that has the 'spread' ability, I should use it to open the box so I can access the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The Utility Knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, which should have opened it. Now I can grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside the box.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n14. Thought: The Empty Gaylord Box remains closed despite placing the Utility Knife on it. I need to find another way to open the box or retrieve the yellow rubber boot. Since the Steel Crowbar inside the box provides the 'assemble' ability, I might need to find another tool outside the box that can help open it. Looking back at the Sorting Floor, there's a Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) that provides the 'screw' ability, which might be useful for opening the box.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n15. Thought: The Utility Knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. Now I need to try using the Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) from the Sorting Floor, which provides the 'screw' ability, to open the box.

Thought: The task is to move the only yellow, large rubber boot to the sorting_table_1. From the environment, I can see that the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) is inside the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) in the Intake Bay. I need to first grab the boot from the box and then take it to the sorting_table_1 in the Sorting Floor room.\n\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box, I need to grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside it.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n3. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the boot.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since I cannot directly open the box, I need to find a tool that can help me open it. Looking at the environment, there's a Steel Crowbar (crowbar_1) inside the same box that provides the 'assemble' ability, which might help in opening the box.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n5. Thought: The rubber boot is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, and I cannot directly open or access it. Since the Steel Crowbar is also inside the same closed box, I need to find another tool in the environment that can help open the box. Looking at the Sorting Floor room, there's a Utility Knife (knife_1) that provides the 'spread' ability, which might help in opening the box. I should go to the Sorting Floor to get the knife.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: Now that I'm in the Sorting Floor room, I need to locate the Utility Knife (knife_1) which can help me open the Empty Gaylord Box. The knife is currently in the Sorting Floor room, so I should go to its location.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the Utility Knife (knife_1), I should grab it to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the Utility Knife with the 'spread' ability, I can return to the Intake Bay to open the Empty Gaylord Box and retrieve the yellow rubber boot.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I'm back in the Intake Bay with the Utility Knife, I need to use its 'spread' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) so I can access the yellow rubber boot inside.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n10. Thought: I need to use the 'spread' ability provided by the Utility Knife (knife_1) that I'm holding to open the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1). Since the knife provides the ability, I should attempt to open the box directly.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n11. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) first before attempting to use the Utility Knife to open it.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm at the Empty Gaylord Box (gaylord_box_1) with the Utility Knife (knife_1) that has the 'spread' ability, I should use it to open the box so I can access the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The Utility Knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, which should have opened it. Now I can grab the yellow rubber boot (rubber_boot_1) from inside the box.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n14. Thought: The Empty Gaylord Box remains closed despite placing the Utility Knife on it. I need to find another way to open the box or retrieve the yellow rubber boot. Since the Steel Crowbar inside the box provides the 'assemble' ability, I might need to find another tool outside the box that can help open it. Looking back at the Sorting Floor, there's a Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) that provides the 'screw' ability, which might be useful for opening the box.\n\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n15. Thought: The Utility Knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. Now I need to try using the Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1) from the Sorting Floor, which provides the 'screw' ability, to open the box. First, I need to locate and grab the screwdriver.\n\nAction: GOTO screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Phillips Screwdriver (in Sorting Floor)\n16. Thought: Now that I'm near the Phillips Screwdriver (screwdriver_1), I should grab it to use its 'screw' ability to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Phillips Screwdriver\n17.

Thought: I now have the Phillips Screwdriver with the 'screw' ability and am at the Empty Gaylord Box. I should use the screwdriver to open the box so I can access the yellow rubber boot inside.\nAction: PLACE screwdriver_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Phillips Screwdriver on Empty Gaylord Box\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
