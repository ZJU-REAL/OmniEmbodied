Thought: Since the TURN_ON command is not supported and exploring didn't reveal any new objects, I need to find another way to interact with the pit wall console. The console might have a physical switch or button that can be toggled. I should try to interact with it directly.\nAction: INTERACT pit_wall_console_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INTERACT\n5. Thought: Since direct commands like TURN_ON and INTERACT are not supported, I need to find another way to turn on the pit wall console. The console might require a power source or a specific tool. Looking at the available objects, the diagnostic laptop might be able to interact with the console.\nAction: GOTO diagnostic_laptop_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Diagnostic Laptop (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: The diagnostic laptop is currently off and might be needed to interact with the pit wall console. I should turn on the laptop first.\nAction: GRAB diagnostic_laptop_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Diagnostic Laptop\n7. Thought: The diagnostic laptop is now in my inventory, and it might be able to interact with the pit wall console.

Thought: The TURN_ON command is not supported. I need to find an alternative way to turn on the pit wall console. Since the console is a device, it might require a power source or a specific tool to activate it. I should look for a power switch or a tool that can interact with electronic devices.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Race Car Service Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: Since the TURN_ON command is not supported and exploring didn't reveal any new objects, I need to find another way to interact with the pit wall console. The console might have a physical switch or button that can be toggled. I should try to interact with it directly.\nAction: INTERACT pit_wall_console_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INTERACT\n5. Thought: Since direct commands like TURN_ON and INTERACT are not supported, I need to find another way to turn on the pit wall console. The console might require a power source or a specific tool. Looking at the available objects, the diagnostic laptop might be able to interact with the console.\nAction: GOTO diagnostic_laptop_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Diagnostic Laptop (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: The diagnostic laptop is currently off and might be needed to interact with the pit wall console. I should turn on the laptop first.\nAction: GRAB diagnostic_laptop_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Diagnostic Laptop\n7. Thought: The diagnostic laptop is now in my inventory, and it might be able to interact with the pit wall console. I should go back to the console to attempt to use the laptop on it.\nAction: GOTO pit_wall_console_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Pit Wall Console (in Race Car Service Bay)\n8. Thought: The diagnostic laptop is now in hand and I'm at the pit wall console. Since direct commands like TURN_ON aren't supported, I'll try using the laptop on the console to turn it on.\nAction: PLACE diagnostic_laptop_1 on pit_wall_console_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Diagnostic Laptop on Pit Wall Console\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The Fresh Firehawk Tires weigh 12.0kg, which exceeds the agent's maximum load capacity of 10.0kg. Since the task requires moving these tires to the tire cart, I need to find a way to transport them without exceeding the weight limit. The tire cart is a container that can hold the tires, so I should move the tire cart to the tires instead.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires moving the uniquely qualifying-stickered Firehawk tires to the tire cart. The tires are located in the Race Car Service Bay, and the tire cart is also in the same room. I need to go to the Race Car Service Bay first.\nAction: GOTO race_car_service_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Race Car Service Bay\n2. Thought: The uniquely qualifying-stickered Firehawk tires are located in the Race Car Service Bay, and the tire cart is also in the same room. I need to grab the tires first.\nAction: GRAB fresh_firehawk_tires_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Fresh Firehawk Tires before grabbing\n3. Thought: The agent needs to approach the Fresh Firehawk Tires before attempting to grab them. Since the tires are in the same room, I will move to their location first.\nAction: GOTO fresh_firehawk_tires_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Fresh Firehawk Tires (in Race Car Service Bay)\n4. Thought: Now that the agent is near the Fresh Firehawk Tires, I can grab them to prepare for moving them to the tire cart.\nAction: GRAB fresh_firehawk_tires_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - 超出重量限制（当前:0.0kg + 物体:12.0kg > 最大:10.0kg）\n5. Thought: The Fresh Firehawk Tires weigh 12.0kg, which exceeds the agent's maximum load capacity of 10.0kg. Since the task requires moving these tires to the tire cart, I need to find a way to transport them without exceeding the weight limit. The tire cart is a container that can hold the tires, so I should move the tire cart to the tires instead.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6. Thought: The tire cart is now near the agent, and it can hold the Fresh Firehawk Tires. I will place the tires into the tire cart to complete the task.\nAction: PLACE fresh_firehawk_tires_1 in tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: fresh_firehawk_tires_1\n7. Thought: The agent needs to grab the Fresh Firehawk Tires first before placing them in the tire cart. Since the tires are too heavy to carry, the agent should move the tire cart to the tires' location and then place the tires inside the cart.\nAction: GOTO fresh_firehawk_tires_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Fresh Firehawk Tires (in Race Car Service Bay)\n8. Thought: The Fresh Firehawk Tires are too heavy to carry, but the tire cart is now near them.

Thought: The agent needs to approach the Fresh Firehawk Tires before attempting to grab them. Since the tires are in the same room, I will move to their location first.\nAction: GOTO fresh_firehawk_tires_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Fresh Firehawk Tires (in Race Car Service Bay)\n4.

Thought: The Fresh Firehawk Tires weigh 12.0kg, which exceeds the agent's maximum load capacity of 10.0kg. Since the task requires moving these tires to the tire cart, I need to find a way to transport them without exceeding the weight limit. The tire cart is a container that can hold the tires, so I should move the tire cart to the tires instead.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6.

Thought: The agent needs to grab the Fresh Firehawk Tires first before placing them in the tire cart. Since the tires are too heavy to carry, the agent should move the tire cart to the tires' location and then place the tires inside the cart.\nAction: GOTO fresh_firehawk_tires_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Fresh Firehawk Tires (in Race Car Service Bay)\n8.

Thought: The Fresh Firehawk Tires are too heavy to carry, but the tire cart is now near them. The tire cart needs to be opened first to place the tires inside.

Since the task requires moving these tires to the tire cart, I need to find a way to transport them without exceeding the weight limit. The tire cart is a container that can hold the tires, so I should move the tire cart to the tires instead.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n6.
