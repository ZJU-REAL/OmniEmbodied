Thought: The task requires using a confiscated toolbox to repair a printer with an error light on. However, the current environment does not mention any toolbox or printer, and no objects have been found in any room. Therefore, the first step is to explore the environment to locate the toolbox and the printer.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1彻底探索了Central Operations Room，发现了9个新物体\n2. Thought: The environment has been explored, and the printer (ID: printer_1) is located in the Central Operations Room with an error light on. However, the toolbox is not mentioned in the environment description. The next step is to check if the toolbox is in the same room or another room to locate it.\nAction: INSPECT_OBJECT printer_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INSPECT_OBJECT\n3. Thought: The printer (ID: printer_1) is located in the Central Operations Room with an error light on. The next step is to search for the confiscated toolbox in the same room, as it is required to repair the printer. Since the toolbox is not mentioned in the environment description, I need to explore the room again to locate it.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1探索了Central Operations Room，但没有发现新物体\n4. Thought: The printer (ID: printer_1) is in the Central Operations Room with an error light on, but the toolbox is not mentioned in the environment. Since the room has already been explored and no new objects were found, the next step is to check the contents of the Large Wooden Planning Table (ID: planning_table_1) where the printer is located, as the toolbox might be there.\nAction: INSPECT_OBJECT planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INSPECT_OBJECT\n5. Thought: The printer (ID: printer_1) is in the Central Operations Room with an error light on, but the toolbox is not mentioned in the environment. Since the room has already been explored and no new objects were found, the next step is to check the contents of the Large Wooden Planning Table (ID: planning_table_1) where the printer is located, as the toolbox might be there.  \nAction: OPEN planning_table_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1成功对Large Wooden Planning Table执行了open操作，is_open从False变为True\n6.
