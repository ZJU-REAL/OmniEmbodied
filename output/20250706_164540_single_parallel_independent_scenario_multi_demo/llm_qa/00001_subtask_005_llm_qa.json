Thought: The task requires finding a blinking soldering iron station on a steel workbench and turning it off. However, the current environment information does not mention any soldering iron station or steel workbench. Therefore, I need to explore the environment to locate the required objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1彻底探索了Filter Simulation Station，发现了11个新物体\n2. Thought: The environment has been explored, and the Filter Simulation Station contains several objects, including a Triple-Monitor Setup, a Server Rack, and various items. However, there is no mention of a soldering iron station or a steel workbench. The task requires locating a blinking soldering iron station on a steel workbench, which is not yet found. Therefore, I need to check the other rooms to find the required objects.\nAction: MOVE_TO_ROOM Storage & Component Shelves\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: MOVE_TO_ROOM\n3. Thought: The previous attempt to move to the \"Storage & Component Shelves\" room was invalid. I need to check the remaining rooms to locate the soldering iron station and steel workbench. The next room to explore is the \"Main Workbench Area\".\nAction: MOVE_TO_ROOM Main Workbench Area\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: MOVE_TO_ROOM\n4. Thought: The previous attempts to move to other rooms were invalid. I need to check the remaining rooms to locate the soldering iron station and steel workbench. The next room to explore is the \"Signal Generation & Testing Bay\".\nAction: MOVE_TO_ROOM Signal Generation & Testing Bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: MOVE_TO_ROOM\n5. Thought: The previous attempts to move to other rooms were invalid. I need to check the remaining rooms to locate the soldering iron station and steel workbench. The next room to explore is the \"Signal Generation & Testing Bay\".\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1探索了Filter Simulation Station，但没有发现新物体\n6. Thought: The environment has been explored, and the only room with potential relevant objects is the Filter Simulation Station. However, no soldering iron station or steel workbench was found. The task requires locating a blinking soldering iron station on a steel workbench, which is not yet found. Since no other rooms can be explored, I need to check the objects in the Filter Simulation Station again to confirm if the soldering iron station or steel workbench was missed.\nAction: INSPECT_OBJECT Triple-Monitor Setup\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INSPECT_OBJECT\n7. Thought: The previous attempt to inspect the Triple-Monitor Setup was invalid. I need to check the objects in the Filter Simulation Station again to confirm if the soldering iron station or steel workbench was missed. The next step is to inspect the Server Rack, as it is a large steel structure that could be considered a workbench.\nAction: INSPECT_OBJECT Server Rack\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INSPECT_OBJECT\n8. Thought: The previous attempts to inspect objects were invalid. I need to use the correct commands to interact with the environment. The next step is to check if the Server Rack can be opened to look for a soldering iron station or steel workbench.  \nAction: OPEN Server Rack\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 命令格式错误: OPEN Server Rack\n9. Thought: The previous attempts to interact with objects were invalid due to incorrect command formats. The correct command to open the Server Rack is \"OPEN Server Rack_1\" (including the object ID). I will try this command again to check if the soldering iron station or steel workbench is located there.  \nAction: OPEN Server Rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 命令格式错误: OPEN Server Rack_1\n10.
