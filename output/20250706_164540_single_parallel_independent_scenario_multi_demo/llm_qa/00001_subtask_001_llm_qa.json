Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp is not found in any of the described rooms, and the current environment does not mention any objects or lamps. I need to explore the Filter Simulation Station again to check for the lamp.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1彻底探索了Filter Simulation Station，发现了11个新物体\n2. Thought: After exploring the Filter Simulation Station, new objects were discovered, but the dual-arm magnifying lamp is still not found. I need to check the newly discovered objects to locate the lamp.\nAction: INSPECT_OBJECTS\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INSPECT_OBJECTS\n3. Thought: The command \"INSPECT_OBJECTS\" is invalid, so I need to use a valid action to check the newly discovered objects in the Filter Simulation Station. The next step is to inspect the objects one by one to locate the dual-arm magnifying lamp.\nAction: INSPECT_OBJECT triple_monitor_setup_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INSPECT_OBJECT\n4. Thought: The command \"INSPECT_OBJECT\" is invalid, so I need to use a valid action to check the newly discovered objects in the Filter Simulation Station. The next step is to explore the Filter Simulation Station again to ensure all objects are checked.  \nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1探索了Filter Simulation Station，但没有发现新物体\n5. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found yet, and the previous exploration did not reveal any new objects. I need to check the objects in the Filter Simulation Station more carefully, focusing on potential locations for the lamp.  \nAction: INSPECT_OBJECT triple_monitor_setup_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: INSPECT_OBJECT\n6. Thought: The command \"INSPECT_OBJECT\" is invalid, so I need to use a valid action to check the newly discovered objects in the Filter Simulation Station. The next step is to inspect the objects one by one to locate the dual-arm magnifying lamp.  \nAction: LOOK_AT triple_monitor_setup_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: LOOK_AT\n7. Thought: The valid actions available are limited, and the previous attempts to inspect objects have failed due to invalid commands. The next step is to use the \"LOOK\" command to check the Triple-Monitor Setup for the dual-arm magnifying lamp.  \nAction: LOOK triple_monitor_setup_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了Triple-Monitor Setup\n8. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found yet. The Triple-Monitor Setup was inspected, but the lamp is still not located. I need to check other objects in the Filter Simulation Station to find the lamp.  \nAction: LOOK server_rack_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了Server Rack\n9. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found yet. The Triple-Monitor Setup and Server Rack were inspected, but the lamp is still not located. I need to check other objects in the Filter Simulation Station to find the lamp.  \nAction: LOOK think_poster_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了Think Before You Quantize Poster\n10. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found yet. I need to continue inspecting other objects in the Filter Simulation Station to locate the lamp.  \nAction: LOOK reference_filter_printouts_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了Reference Filter Printouts\n11. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found yet. I need to continue inspecting other objects in the Filter Simulation Station to locate the lamp.  \nAction: LOOK mechanical_keyboard_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了Mechanical Keyboard\n12. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found in the inspected objects. I need to check the remaining objects in the Filter Simulation Station to locate the lamp.  \nAction: LOOK external_hdd_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了External HDD\n13. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found in any of the inspected objects. I need to check the remaining objects in the Filter Simulation Station to locate the lamp.  \nAction: LOOK sticky_notes_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了Sticky Notes\n14. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found in any of the inspected objects in the Filter Simulation Station. I need to check the remaining objects in the station to locate the lamp.  \nAction: LOOK dead_succulent_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1查看了Dead Succulent\n15. Thought: The dual-arm magnifying lamp has not been found in any of the objects in the Filter Simulation Station. Since no further objects are left to inspect, the lamp must be in a different location or not part of the described environment. The task cannot be completed with the current information.\nAction: END_TASK\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: END_TASK\n16.
