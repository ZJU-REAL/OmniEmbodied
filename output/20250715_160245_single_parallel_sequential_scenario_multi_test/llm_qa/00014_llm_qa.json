Thought: I have successfully grabbed the official weigh basket. Now I need to place it on the bio_check_station_1. However, I don't see the bio_check_station_1 in the current room or any other rooms listed. I should explore the Fish Holding & Processing Area to find it.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Weigh-In Platform but found no new objects\n5.

Now I need to place the official weigh basket on it.\nAction: PLACE official_weigh_basket_1 on bio_check_station_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach bio_check_station_1 before placing object\n8.
