Thought: The task requires placing a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink on a coffee table, but there is no such drink or coffee table in the current environment. I need to explore other rooms to find these objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Race Car Service Bay but found no new objects\n2. Thought: The current environment doesn't contain a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink or a coffee table. Since exploration of the current room didn't reveal these objects, I should move to another room to search for them.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n3. Thought: The current room (Driver & Crew Lounge) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink and coffee table.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Driver & Crew Lounge and discovered 15 new objects\n4. Thought: The lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink is located inside the cooler box in the Driver & Crew Lounge, and the coffee table is also in the same room. I need to first grab the drink from the cooler box and then place it on the coffee table.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n5. Thought: The electrolyte drink is inside the closed cooler box. I need to open the cooler box first before I can grab the drink.\nAction: GOTO cooler_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cooler Box (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n6. Thought: The cooler box is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink inside. Since I'm already at the cooler box, I should attempt to open it.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n7. Thought: The cooler box is still closed, preventing access to the electrolyte drink. I need to find a way to open the cooler box first.\nAction: GOTO grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Grease Stained Glove (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n8. Thought: The grease stained glove contains a physical override key that can be used to open containers. I need to grab the key from the glove to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n9. Thought: The physical override key is inside the closed grease stained glove. I need to open the glove first to access the key, which can then be used to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it physical_override_key_1, cannot grab\n10. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the glove directly (as it contains the key), I need to open the glove first to access the key.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n11. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the key directly, I need to find another way to open the glove. The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station might help, but it's in another room. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other objects in the current room that can help open the glove.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Driver & Crew Lounge but found no new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

I need to explore other rooms to find these objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Race Car Service Bay but found no new objects\n2. Thought: The current environment doesn't contain a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink or a coffee table. Since exploration of the current room didn't reveal these objects, I should move to another room to search for them.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n3. Thought: The current room (Driver & Crew Lounge) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink and coffee table.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Driver & Crew Lounge and discovered 15 new objects\n4. Thought: The lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink is located inside the cooler box in the Driver & Crew Lounge, and the coffee table is also in the same room. I need to first grab the drink from the cooler box and then place it on the coffee table.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n5. Thought: The electrolyte drink is inside the closed cooler box. I need to open the cooler box first before I can grab the drink.\nAction: GOTO cooler_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cooler Box (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n6. Thought: The cooler box is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink inside. Since I'm already at the cooler box, I should attempt to open it.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n7. Thought: The cooler box is still closed, preventing access to the electrolyte drink. I need to find a way to open the cooler box first.\nAction: GOTO grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Grease Stained Glove (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n8. Thought: The grease stained glove contains a physical override key that can be used to open containers. I need to grab the key from the glove to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n9. Thought: The physical override key is inside the closed grease stained glove. I need to open the glove first to access the key, which can then be used to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it physical_override_key_1, cannot grab\n10. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the glove directly (as it contains the key), I need to open the glove first to access the key.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n11. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the key directly, I need to find another way to open the glove. The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station might help, but it's in another room. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other objects in the current room that can help open the glove.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Driver & Crew Lounge but found no new objects\n12. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since there are no other tools in the current room to open the glove, I need to go to the Charity Logistics Station to get the box cutter which can help open containers.\nAction: GOTO charity_logistics_station\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Charity Logistics Station\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the key directly, I need to find another way to open the glove. The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station might help, but it's in another room. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other objects in the current room that can help open the glove.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Driver & Crew Lounge but found no new objects\n12.

Thought: The task requires placing a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink on a coffee table, but there is no such drink or coffee table in the current environment. I need to explore other rooms to find these objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Race Car Service Bay but found no new objects\n2. Thought: The current environment doesn't contain a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink or a coffee table. Since exploration of the current room didn't reveal these objects, I should move to another room to search for them.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n3. Thought: The current room (Driver & Crew Lounge) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink and coffee table.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Driver & Crew Lounge and discovered 15 new objects\n4. Thought: The lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink is located inside the cooler box in the Driver & Crew Lounge, and the coffee table is also in the same room. I need to first grab the drink from the cooler box and then place it on the coffee table.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n5. Thought: The electrolyte drink is inside the closed cooler box. I need to open the cooler box first before I can grab the drink.\nAction: GOTO cooler_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cooler Box (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n6. Thought: The cooler box is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink inside. Since I'm already at the cooler box, I should attempt to open it.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n7. Thought: The cooler box is still closed, preventing access to the electrolyte drink. I need to find a way to open the cooler box first.\nAction: GOTO grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Grease Stained Glove (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n8. Thought: The grease stained glove contains a physical override key that can be used to open containers. I need to grab the key from the glove to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n9. Thought: The physical override key is inside the closed grease stained glove. I need to open the glove first to access the key, which can then be used to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it physical_override_key_1, cannot grab\n10. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the glove directly (as it contains the key), I need to open the glove first to access the key.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n11. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the key directly, I need to find another way to open the glove. The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station might help, but it's in another room. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other objects in the current room that can help open the glove.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Driver & Crew Lounge but found no new objects\n12. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since there are no other tools in the current room to open the glove, I need to go to the Charity Logistics Station to get the box cutter which can help open containers.\nAction: GOTO charity_logistics_station\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Charity Logistics Station\n13. Thought: The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station can be used to open containers. I need to grab it to open the grease stained glove in the Driver & Crew Lounge.\nAction: GRAB box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Box Cutter before grabbing\n14.

Thought: The task requires placing a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink on a coffee table, but there is no such drink or coffee table in the current environment. I need to explore other rooms to find these objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Race Car Service Bay but found no new objects\n2. Thought: The current environment doesn't contain a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink or a coffee table. Since exploration of the current room didn't reveal these objects, I should move to another room to search for them.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n3. Thought: The current room (Driver & Crew Lounge) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink and coffee table.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Driver & Crew Lounge and discovered 15 new objects\n4. Thought: The lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink is located inside the cooler box in the Driver & Crew Lounge, and the coffee table is also in the same room. I need to first grab the drink from the cooler box and then place it on the coffee table.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n5. Thought: The electrolyte drink is inside the closed cooler box. I need to open the cooler box first before I can grab the drink.\nAction: GOTO cooler_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cooler Box (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n6. Thought: The cooler box is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink inside. Since I'm already at the cooler box, I should attempt to open it.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n7. Thought: The cooler box is still closed, preventing access to the electrolyte drink. I need to find a way to open the cooler box first.\nAction: GOTO grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Grease Stained Glove (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n8. Thought: The grease stained glove contains a physical override key that can be used to open containers. I need to grab the key from the glove to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n9. Thought: The physical override key is inside the closed grease stained glove. I need to open the glove first to access the key, which can then be used to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it physical_override_key_1, cannot grab\n10. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the glove directly (as it contains the key), I need to open the glove first to access the key.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n11. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the key directly, I need to find another way to open the glove. The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station might help, but it's in another room. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other objects in the current room that can help open the glove.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Driver & Crew Lounge but found no new objects\n12. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since there are no other tools in the current room to open the glove, I need to go to the Charity Logistics Station to get the box cutter which can help open containers.\nAction: GOTO charity_logistics_station\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Charity Logistics Station\n13. Thought: The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station can be used to open containers. I need to grab it to open the grease stained glove in the Driver & Crew Lounge.\nAction: GRAB box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Box Cutter before grabbing\n14. Thought: The box cutter is on the folding banquet table in the Charity Logistics Station. I need to approach it first before attempting to grab it.\nAction: GOTO box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Box Cutter (in Charity Logistics Station)\n15. Thought: Now that I'm at the box cutter, I can grab it to use for opening containers. This will allow me to access the physical override key inside the grease stained glove.\nAction: GRAB box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Box Cutter\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires placing a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink on a coffee table, but there is no such drink or coffee table in the current environment. I need to explore other rooms to find these objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Race Car Service Bay but found no new objects\n2. Thought: The current environment doesn't contain a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink or a coffee table. Since exploration of the current room didn't reveal these objects, I should move to another room to search for them.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n3. Thought: The current room (Driver & Crew Lounge) has no objects discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink and coffee table.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Driver & Crew Lounge and discovered 15 new objects\n4. Thought: The lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink is located inside the cooler box in the Driver & Crew Lounge, and the coffee table is also in the same room. I need to first grab the drink from the cooler box and then place it on the coffee table.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n5. Thought: The electrolyte drink is inside the closed cooler box. I need to open the cooler box first before I can grab the drink.\nAction: GOTO cooler_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cooler Box (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n6. Thought: The cooler box is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink inside. Since I'm already at the cooler box, I should attempt to open it.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n7. Thought: The cooler box is still closed, preventing access to the electrolyte drink. I need to find a way to open the cooler box first.\nAction: GOTO grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Grease Stained Glove (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n8. Thought: The grease stained glove contains a physical override key that can be used to open containers. I need to grab the key from the glove to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n9. Thought: The physical override key is inside the closed grease stained glove. I need to open the glove first to access the key, which can then be used to open the cooler box.\nAction: GRAB grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it physical_override_key_1, cannot grab\n10. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the glove directly (as it contains the key), I need to open the glove first to access the key.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n11. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the key directly, I need to find another way to open the glove. The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station might help, but it's in another room. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other objects in the current room that can help open the glove.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Driver & Crew Lounge but found no new objects\n12. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since there are no other tools in the current room to open the glove, I need to go to the Charity Logistics Station to get the box cutter which can help open containers.\nAction: GOTO charity_logistics_station\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Charity Logistics Station\n13. Thought: The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station can be used to open containers. I need to grab it to open the grease stained glove in the Driver & Crew Lounge.\nAction: GRAB box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Box Cutter before grabbing\n14. Thought: The box cutter is on the folding banquet table in the Charity Logistics Station. I need to approach it first before attempting to grab it.\nAction: GOTO box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Box Cutter (in Charity Logistics Station)\n15. Thought: Now that I'm at the box cutter, I can grab it to use for opening containers. This will allow me to access the physical override key inside the grease stained glove.\nAction: GRAB box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Box Cutter\n16. Thought: Now that I have the box cutter, I can return to the Driver & Crew Lounge to open the grease stained glove and access the physical override key, which will then allow me to open the cooler box and get the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n17. Thought: Now that I'm back in the Driver & Crew Lounge with the box cutter, I need to use it to open the grease stained glove to access the physical override key inside.\nAction: GRAB grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

I need to explore other rooms to find these objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Race Car Service Bay but found no new objects\n2. Thought: The current environment doesn't contain a lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink or a coffee table. Since exploration of the current room didn't reveal these objects, I should move to another room to search for them.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n3.

I need to explore this room to find the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink and coffee table.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Driver & Crew Lounge and discovered 15 new objects\n4. Thought: The lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink is located inside the cooler box in the Driver & Crew Lounge, and the coffee table is also in the same room. I need to first grab the drink from the cooler box and then place it on the coffee table.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n5. Thought: The electrolyte drink is inside the closed cooler box.

Thought: The cooler box is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink inside. Since I'm already at the cooler box, I should attempt to open it.\nAction: GRAB electrolyte_drink_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object electrolyte_drink_1 is in closed container Cooler Box\n7. Thought: The cooler box is still closed, preventing access to the electrolyte drink. I need to find a way to open the cooler box first.\nAction: GOTO grease_stained_glove_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Grease Stained Glove (in Driver & Crew Lounge)\n8.

Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the glove directly (as it contains the key), I need to open the glove first to access the key.\nAction: GRAB physical_override_key_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object physical_override_key_1 is in closed container Grease Stained Glove\n11. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since I can't grab the key directly, I need to find another way to open the glove. The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station might help, but it's in another room. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other objects in the current room that can help open the glove.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Driver & Crew Lounge but found no new objects\n12. Thought: The grease stained glove is closed and contains the physical override key needed to open the cooler box. Since there are no other tools in the current room to open the glove, I need to go to the Charity Logistics Station to get the box cutter which can help open containers.\nAction: GOTO charity_logistics_station\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Charity Logistics Station\n13. Thought: The box cutter in the Charity Logistics Station can be used to open containers. I need to grab it to open the grease stained glove in the Driver & Crew Lounge.\nAction: GRAB box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Box Cutter before grabbing\n14. Thought: The box cutter is on the folding banquet table in the Charity Logistics Station. I need to approach it first before attempting to grab it.\nAction: GOTO box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Box Cutter (in Charity Logistics Station)\n15. Thought: Now that I'm at the box cutter, I can grab it to use for opening containers. This will allow me to access the physical override key inside the grease stained glove.\nAction: GRAB box_cutter_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Box Cutter\n16. Thought: Now that I have the box cutter, I can return to the Driver & Crew Lounge to open the grease stained glove and access the physical override key, which will then allow me to open the cooler box and get the lemon-lime flavored electrolyte drink.\nAction: GOTO driver_crew_lounge\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Driver & Crew Lounge\n17.

First, I need to locate the damaged front wing, which is on the tire cart in the Race Car Service Bay. Then, I need to find the paint and brush, which are on the workbench in the same room. Since I'm already in the Race Car Service Bay, I can proceed to collect the necessary items.\n\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n2.

Thought: I currently have the paint brush in my grasp but need to also grab the paint can. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down temporarily to pick up the paint can.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires painting the damaged front wing with red Rust-Oleum paint and a 2-inch brush. First, I need to locate the damaged front wing, which is on the tire cart in the Race Car Service Bay. Then, I need to find the paint and brush, which are on the workbench in the same room. Since I'm already in the Race Car Service Bay, I can proceed to collect the necessary items.\n\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n2.

Thought: I currently have the paint brush in my grasp but need to also grab the paint can. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down temporarily to pick up the paint can.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n7. Thought: Now that the paint brush is placed back on the workbench, I can grab the paint can.

Thought: The task requires painting the damaged front wing with red Rust-Oleum paint and a 2-inch brush. First, I need to locate the damaged front wing, which is on the tire cart in the Race Car Service Bay. Then, I need to find the paint and brush, which are on the workbench in the same room. Since I'm already in the Race Car Service Bay, I can proceed to collect the necessary items.\n\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n2.

Thought: I currently have the paint brush in my grasp but need to also grab the paint can. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down temporarily to pick up the paint can.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n7. Thought: Now that the paint brush is placed back on the workbench, I can grab the paint can. After getting the paint can, I'll need to pick up the paint brush again to have both items ready for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n8.

Thought: I'm now at the tire cart with the paint can. To proceed with painting the damaged front wing, I need to have both the paint can and paint brush. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I should place the paint can on the tire cart temporarily, go back to get the paint brush, then return to the tire cart to perform the painting.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Tire Cart\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires painting the damaged front wing with red Rust-Oleum paint and a 2-inch brush. First, I need to locate the damaged front wing, which is on the tire cart in the Race Car Service Bay. Then, I need to find the paint and brush, which are on the workbench in the same room. Since I'm already in the Race Car Service Bay, I can proceed to collect the necessary items.\n\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I need to pick up the paint brush and the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n3. Thought: I need to free up my grasp capacity by placing the sandpaper I'm currently holding before I can grab the paint brush and paint can.\nAction: PLACE sandpaper_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sandpaper on Workbench\n4. Thought: Now that I've placed the sandpaper back on the workbench, I can proceed to grab both the paint brush and the paint can needed for the task.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n5. Thought: Now that I have the paint brush, I need to grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can from the workbench to proceed with painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n6. Thought: I currently have the paint brush in my grasp but need to also grab the paint can. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down temporarily to pick up the paint can.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n7. Thought: Now that the paint brush is placed back on the workbench, I can grab the paint can. After getting the paint can, I'll need to pick up the paint brush again to have both items ready for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n8.

Thought: I currently have the paint can in my grasp but need both the paint can and paint brush to complete the task. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to go to the damaged front wing first with the paint can, then return to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n10. Thought: I'm now at the tire cart with the paint can. To proceed with painting the damaged front wing, I need to have both the paint can and paint brush. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I should place the paint can on the tire cart temporarily, go back to get the paint brush, then return to the tire cart to perform the painting.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Tire Cart\n11. Thought: Now that the paint can is placed on the tire cart, I need to go back to the workbench to pick up the paint brush so I can have both items ready for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to pick up the paint brush to bring it to the tire cart where the paint can and damaged front wing are located.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires painting the damaged front wing with red Rust-Oleum paint and a 2-inch brush. First, I need to locate the damaged front wing, which is on the tire cart in the Race Car Service Bay. Then, I need to find the paint and brush, which are on the workbench in the same room. Since I'm already in the Race Car Service Bay, I can proceed to collect the necessary items.\n\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the workbench, I need to pick up the paint brush and the red Rust-Oleum paint can to prepare for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n3. Thought: I need to free up my grasp capacity by placing the sandpaper I'm currently holding before I can grab the paint brush and paint can.\nAction: PLACE sandpaper_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Sandpaper on Workbench\n4. Thought: Now that I've placed the sandpaper back on the workbench, I can proceed to grab both the paint brush and the paint can needed for the task.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n5. Thought: Now that I have the paint brush, I need to grab the red Rust-Oleum paint can from the workbench to proceed with painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n6. Thought: I currently have the paint brush in my grasp but need to also grab the paint can. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to place the paint brush down temporarily to pick up the paint can.\nAction: PLACE paint_brush_1 on workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Brush on Workbench\n7. Thought: Now that the paint brush is placed back on the workbench, I can grab the paint can. After getting the paint can, I'll need to pick up the paint brush again to have both items ready for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GRAB paint_can_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Can\n8.

Thought: I currently have the paint can in my grasp but need both the paint can and paint brush to complete the task. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I need to go to the damaged front wing first with the paint can, then return to get the paint brush.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n10. Thought: I'm now at the tire cart with the paint can. To proceed with painting the damaged front wing, I need to have both the paint can and paint brush. Since I can only hold one item at a time, I should place the paint can on the tire cart temporarily, go back to get the paint brush, then return to the tire cart to perform the painting.\nAction: PLACE paint_can_1 on tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Paint Can on Tire Cart\n11. Thought: Now that the paint can is placed on the tire cart, I need to go back to the workbench to pick up the paint brush so I can have both items ready for painting the damaged front wing.\nAction: GOTO workbench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Workbench (in Race Car Service Bay)\n12. Thought: Now that I'm back at the workbench, I need to pick up the paint brush to bring it to the tire cart where the paint can and damaged front wing are located.\nAction: GRAB paint_brush_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Paint Brush\n13. Thought: Now that I have the paint brush, I need to return to the tire cart where the paint can and damaged front wing are located to perform the painting task.\nAction: GOTO tire_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Tire Cart (in Race Car Service Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
