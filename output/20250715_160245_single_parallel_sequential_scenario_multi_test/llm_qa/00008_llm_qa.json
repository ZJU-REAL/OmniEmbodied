Thought: The satellite phone is in the Central Operations Room, but I'm currently in the Medical Triage & Storage room. I need to go to the Central Operations Room to access the satellite phone.\nAction: GOTO central_operations\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Central Operations Room\n2. Thought: The satellite phone is on the planning table in the Central Operations Room, but I need to find the confiscated toolbox to repair it. I should explore the current room to locate the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Central Operations Room but found no new objects\n3. Thought: The satellite phone is in the Central Operations Room, but the confiscated toolbox was not found during exploration. I need to check other rooms where the toolbox might be located, starting with the Logistics & Supply Depot as it's a storage area.\nAction: GOTO logistics_depot\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Logistics & Supply Depot\n4. Thought: The confiscated toolbox was not found in the Central Operations Room or Logistics & Supply Depot. I should explore the current room (Logistics & Supply Depot) to check if the toolbox is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Logistics & Supply Depot but found no new objects\n5. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Logistics & Supply Depot. The next likely location would be the Communications & Tech Corner, as it's a technical area where tools might be stored.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n6. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms. Since the Communications & Tech Corner is a technical area, I should explore it to check if the toolbox is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Communications & Tech Corner but found no new objects\n7. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Logistics & Supply Depot, Communications & Tech Corner). The next possible location could be the Staff Break Area or Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. Since the toolbox was confiscated, it might be in the security area.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n8. Thought: The confiscated toolbox was not found in any of the previously explored rooms. Since the toolbox was confiscated, it's most likely to be in the security area (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint). I should explore this room to locate the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n9. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the guard desk. I need to grab it to repair the satellite phone.\nAction: GRAB confiscated_toolbox_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Confiscated Toolbox before grabbing\n10. Thought: The confiscated toolbox is on top of the guard desk in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. I need to approach the guard desk first before I can grab the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO guard_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Guard Desk (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm at the guard desk, I can grab the confiscated toolbox to repair the satellite phone.\nAction: GRAB confiscated_toolbox_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Confiscated Toolbox\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The satellite phone is on the planning table in the Central Operations Room, but I need to find the confiscated toolbox to repair it. I should explore the current room to locate the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Central Operations Room but found no new objects\n3. Thought: The satellite phone is in the Central Operations Room, but the confiscated toolbox was not found during exploration. I need to check other rooms where the toolbox might be located, starting with the Logistics & Supply Depot as it's a storage area.\nAction: GOTO logistics_depot\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Logistics & Supply Depot\n4. Thought: The confiscated toolbox was not found in the Central Operations Room or Logistics & Supply Depot. I should explore the current room (Logistics & Supply Depot) to check if the toolbox is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Logistics & Supply Depot but found no new objects\n5. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has not been found in the Central Operations Room or Logistics & Supply Depot. The next likely location would be the Communications & Tech Corner, as it's a technical area where tools might be stored.\nAction: GOTO communications_corner\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Communications & Tech Corner\n6. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms. Since the Communications & Tech Corner is a technical area, I should explore it to check if the toolbox is here.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Communications & Tech Corner but found no new objects\n7. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has not been found in any of the explored rooms (Central Operations Room, Logistics & Supply Depot, Communications & Tech Corner). The next possible location could be the Staff Break Area or Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. Since the toolbox was confiscated, it might be in the security area.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n8. Thought: The confiscated toolbox was not found in any of the previously explored rooms. Since the toolbox was confiscated, it's most likely to be in the security area (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint). I should explore this room to locate the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n9. Thought: The confiscated toolbox has been found in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint on top of the guard desk. I need to grab it to repair the satellite phone.\nAction: GRAB confiscated_toolbox_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Confiscated Toolbox before grabbing\n10. Thought: The confiscated toolbox is on top of the guard desk in the Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint. I need to approach the guard desk first before I can grab the toolbox.\nAction: GOTO guard_desk_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Guard Desk (in Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm at the guard desk, I can grab the confiscated toolbox to repair the satellite phone.\nAction: GRAB confiscated_toolbox_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Confiscated Toolbox\n12. Thought: Now that I have the confiscated toolbox, I need to return to the Central Operations Room where the satellite phone is located to repair it.\nAction: GOTO central_operations\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Central Operations Room\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Since the toolbox was confiscated, it might be in the security area.\nAction: GOTO front_entrance\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint\n8. Thought: The confiscated toolbox was not found in any of the previously explored rooms. Since the toolbox was confiscated, it's most likely to be in the security area (Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint). I should explore this room to locate the toolbox.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Front Entrance & Security Checkpoint and discovered 10 new objects\n9.
