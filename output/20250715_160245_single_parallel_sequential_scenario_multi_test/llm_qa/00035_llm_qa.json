Thought: To purify the wilted cilantro, I need to first locate both the wilted cilantro and the water filter. The wilted cilantro is inside the reject bin in the processing floor, and the water filter is also in the processing floor. I should go to the reject bin to get the wilted cilantro.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the reject bin, I need to grab the wilted cilantro inside it to prepare for purification with the water filter.\nAction: GRAB wilted_cilantro_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object wilted_cilantro_1 is in closed container Reject Bin\n3. Thought: The wilted cilantro is inside the closed reject bin. I need to open the reject bin first before I can grab the wilted cilantro.\nAction: OPEN reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: OPEN\n4. Thought: The reject bin is currently closed, preventing me from grabbing the wilted cilantro. Since there's no OPEN action available, I need to find another way to access the cilantro. I should explore the room to see if there are any tools that can help open the bin.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Processing & Packaging Floor but found no new objects\n5. Thought: Since the reject bin is closed and there's no direct way to open it, I need to find a tool that can help access the wilted cilantro. The cleaver in the processing floor has the ability to smash, which might help open the bin.\nAction: GOTO cleaver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cleaver (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm near the cleaver, I should grab it to use its smash ability to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro.\nAction: GRAB cleaver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Cleaver\n7. Thought: Now that I have the cleaver with the smash ability, I can use it to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro inside.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n8. Thought: With the cleaver in hand, I can now use its smash ability to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro inside.\nAction: SMASH reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: SMASH\n9. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and the SMASH command didn't work. Since I already have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to use the ability directly to open the reject bin.\nAction: USE smash ON reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: USE\n10. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since I already have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to use the ability to open the reject bin by interacting with it directly.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: To purify the wilted cilantro, I need to first locate both the wilted cilantro and the water filter.

I should go to the reject bin to get the wilted cilantro.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n2.

I need to open the reject bin first before I can grab the wilted cilantro.\nAction: OPEN reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: OPEN\n4. Thought: The reject bin is currently closed, preventing me from grabbing the wilted cilantro. Since there's no OPEN action available, I need to find another way to access the cilantro. I should explore the room to see if there are any tools that can help open the bin.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Processing & Packaging Floor but found no new objects\n5. Thought: Since the reject bin is closed and there's no direct way to open it, I need to find a tool that can help access the wilted cilantro. The cleaver in the processing floor has the ability to smash, which might help open the bin.\nAction: GOTO cleaver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cleaver (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm near the cleaver, I should grab it to use its smash ability to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro.\nAction: GRAB cleaver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Cleaver\n7. Thought: Now that I have the cleaver with the smash ability, I can use it to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro inside.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n8. Thought: With the cleaver in hand, I can now use its smash ability to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro inside.\nAction: SMASH reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: SMASH\n9. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and the SMASH command didn't work. Since I already have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to use the ability directly to open the reject bin.\nAction: USE smash ON reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: USE\n10. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since I already have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to use the ability to open the reject bin by interacting with it directly.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n11. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since I have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to interact with the reject bin directly to open it.\nAction: GRAB reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 超出重量限制（当前:1.5kg + 物体:15.0kg > 最大:10.0kg）\n12. Thought: The reject bin is too heavy to grab, and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since the cleaver provides the smash ability but we can't use it directly, I should try to find another way to access the wilted cilantro. The water filter is already in the processing floor, so I should focus on getting the cilantro first. Maybe I can try to interact with the reject bin differently.\nAction: GRAB wilted_cilantro_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object wilted_cilantro_1 is in closed container Reject Bin\n13. Thought: The reject bin remains closed and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since the cleaver's smash ability cannot be directly used, I should try to find another object that might help open the bin. The pruning shears in the processing floor might be useful for this purpose.\nAction: GOTO pruning_shears_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Pruning Shears (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: To purify the wilted cilantro, I need to first locate both the wilted cilantro and the water filter. The wilted cilantro is inside the reject bin in the processing floor, and the water filter is also in the processing floor. I should go to the reject bin to get the wilted cilantro.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n2. Thought: Now that I'm at the reject bin, I need to grab the wilted cilantro inside it to prepare for purification with the water filter.\nAction: GRAB wilted_cilantro_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object wilted_cilantro_1 is in closed container Reject Bin\n3. Thought: The wilted cilantro is inside the closed reject bin. I need to open the reject bin first before I can grab the wilted cilantro.\nAction: OPEN reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: OPEN\n4. Thought: The reject bin is currently closed, preventing me from grabbing the wilted cilantro. Since there's no OPEN action available, I need to find another way to access the cilantro. I should explore the room to see if there are any tools that can help open the bin.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Processing & Packaging Floor but found no new objects\n5. Thought: Since the reject bin is closed and there's no direct way to open it, I need to find a tool that can help access the wilted cilantro. The cleaver in the processing floor has the ability to smash, which might help open the bin.\nAction: GOTO cleaver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Cleaver (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm near the cleaver, I should grab it to use its smash ability to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro.\nAction: GRAB cleaver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Cleaver\n7. Thought: Now that I have the cleaver with the smash ability, I can use it to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro inside.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n8. Thought: With the cleaver in hand, I can now use its smash ability to open the reject bin and access the wilted cilantro inside.\nAction: SMASH reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: SMASH\n9. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and the SMASH command didn't work. Since I already have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to use the ability directly to open the reject bin.\nAction: USE smash ON reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: USE\n10. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since I already have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to use the ability to open the reject bin by interacting with it directly.\nAction: GOTO reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Reject Bin (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n11. Thought: The reject bin is still closed and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since I have the cleaver which provides the smash ability, I should try to interact with the reject bin directly to open it.\nAction: GRAB reject_bin_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 超出重量限制（当前:1.5kg + 物体:15.0kg > 最大:10.0kg）\n12. Thought: The reject bin is too heavy to grab, and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since the cleaver provides the smash ability but we can't use it directly, I should try to find another way to access the wilted cilantro. The water filter is already in the processing floor, so I should focus on getting the cilantro first. Maybe I can try to interact with the reject bin differently.\nAction: GRAB wilted_cilantro_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object wilted_cilantro_1 is in closed container Reject Bin\n13. Thought: The reject bin remains closed and previous attempts to open it have failed. Since the cleaver's smash ability cannot be directly used, I should try to find another object that might help open the bin. The pruning shears in the processing floor might be useful for this purpose.\nAction: GOTO pruning_shears_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Pruning Shears (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n14. Thought: The pruning shears provide the prune ability, which might help open the reject bin to access the wilted cilantro. I should grab the pruning shears to attempt opening the bin.\nAction: GRAB pruning_shears_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent has reached maximum grab limit (1)\n15. Thought: Since I already have the cleaver and cannot grab the pruning shears due to maximum grab limit, I should try to place the cleaver down to free up my grasp capacity and then attempt to grab the pruning shears.\nAction: PLACE cleaver_1 on conveyor_belt_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach conveyor_belt_1 before placing object\n16. Thought: I need to approach the conveyor belt first to place the cleaver down, freeing up my grasp capacity to then grab the pruning shears.\nAction: GOTO conveyor_belt_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Conveyor Belt System (in Processing & Packaging Floor)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
