I need to explore this room to find the white stained patient intake forms.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Check-In & Reception Desk and discovered 16 new objects\n3. Thought: The patient intake forms (ID: patient_forms_1) are located inside the wall-mounted clipboard holder (ID: clipboard_holder_1). I need to grab them first before placing them on the reception counter.\nAction: GRAB patient_forms_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object patient_forms_1 is in closed container Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder\n4. Thought: The patient intake forms are inside a closed clipboard holder. I need to open the clipboard holder first before I can grab the forms.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n5. Thought: The clipboard holder is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the patient intake forms inside. Since the holder is a container, I should be able to open it once I'm next to it.\nAction: GRAB patient_forms_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object patient_forms_1 is in closed container Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder\n6. Thought: The clipboard holder is still closed, preventing access to the patient intake forms. I need to open the clipboard holder first before attempting to grab the forms.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n7. Thought: The clipboard holder is still closed, and I cannot grab the patient forms directly. I need to find a way to open the clipboard holder first. Since the holder is a container, I should try to interact with it to open it.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n8.

Since the holder is a container, I should try to interact with it to open it.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n9. Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a tool or method to open the clipboard holder. Looking at the environment, there's a cabinet key (key_1) inside the locked filing cabinet that might help, but accessing it would require opening another container. Alternatively, I should check if the clipboard holder can be opened without a key by interacting with it differently.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Looking at the environment, there's a cabinet key (key_1) inside the locked filing cabinet that might help, but accessing it would require opening another container.

Thought: The task requires placing white stained patient intake forms onto the reception counter. However, I don't see any patient intake forms in the current environment. I need to explore the Check-In & Reception Desk room to find them.\nAction: GOTO check_in_reception_desk\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Check-In & Reception Desk\n2. Thought: I have moved to the Check-In & Reception Desk room, but no objects have been discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the white stained patient intake forms.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Check-In & Reception Desk and discovered 16 new objects\n3. Thought: The patient intake forms (ID: patient_forms_1) are located inside the wall-mounted clipboard holder (ID: clipboard_holder_1). I need to grab them first before placing them on the reception counter.\nAction: GRAB patient_forms_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object patient_forms_1 is in closed container Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder\n4. Thought: The patient intake forms are inside a closed clipboard holder. I need to open the clipboard holder first before I can grab the forms.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n5. Thought: The clipboard holder is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the patient intake forms inside. Since the holder is a container, I should be able to open it once I'm next to it.\nAction: GRAB patient_forms_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object patient_forms_1 is in closed container Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder\n6. Thought: The clipboard holder is still closed, preventing access to the patient intake forms. I need to open the clipboard holder first before attempting to grab the forms.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n7. Thought: The clipboard holder is still closed, and I cannot grab the patient forms directly. I need to find a way to open the clipboard holder first. Since the holder is a container, I should try to interact with it to open it.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n8. Thought: The clipboard holder is still closed, and I need to open it to access the patient intake forms. Since the holder is a container, I should try to interact with it to open it.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n9. Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a tool or method to open the clipboard holder. Looking at the environment, there's a cabinet key (key_1) inside the locked filing cabinet that might help, but accessing it would require opening another container. Alternatively, I should check if the clipboard holder can be opened without a key by interacting with it differently.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n10. Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a way to open the clipboard holder. The environment shows that the clipboard holder has an 'is_open' state, which is currently False. I should try to interact with it to change this state.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n11.

Thought: The task requires placing white stained patient intake forms onto the reception counter. However, I don't see any patient intake forms in the current environment. I need to explore the Check-In & Reception Desk room to find them.\nAction: GOTO check_in_reception_desk\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Check-In & Reception Desk\n2. Thought: I have moved to the Check-In & Reception Desk room, but no objects have been discovered yet. I need to explore this room to find the white stained patient intake forms.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Check-In & Reception Desk and discovered 16 new objects\n3. Thought: The patient intake forms (ID: patient_forms_1) are located inside the wall-mounted clipboard holder (ID: clipboard_holder_1). I need to grab them first before placing them on the reception counter.\nAction: GRAB patient_forms_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object patient_forms_1 is in closed container Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder\n4. Thought: The patient intake forms are inside a closed clipboard holder. I need to open the clipboard holder first before I can grab the forms.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n5. Thought: The clipboard holder is currently closed, and I need to open it to access the patient intake forms inside. Since the holder is a container, I should be able to open it once I'm next to it.\nAction: GRAB patient_forms_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object patient_forms_1 is in closed container Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder\n6.

I need to open the clipboard holder first before attempting to grab the forms.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n7. Thought: The clipboard holder is still closed, and I cannot grab the patient forms directly. I need to find a way to open the clipboard holder first. Since the holder is a container, I should try to interact with it to open it.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n8. Thought: The clipboard holder is still closed, and I need to open it to access the patient intake forms. Since the holder is a container, I should try to interact with it to open it.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n9. Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a tool or method to open the clipboard holder. Looking at the environment, there's a cabinet key (key_1) inside the locked filing cabinet that might help, but accessing it would require opening another container. Alternatively, I should check if the clipboard holder can be opened without a key by interacting with it differently.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n10. Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a way to open the clipboard holder. The environment shows that the clipboard holder has an 'is_open' state, which is currently False. I should try to interact with it to change this state.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n11.

Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since direct grabbing attempts have failed, I need to find a tool or method to open the clipboard holder. Looking at the environment, there's a wrench (wrench_1) and screwdriver (screwdriver_1) in the medical cart in the Examination Hallway that might help open the clipboard holder. I should go to the Examination Hallway to get one of these tools.\nAction: GOTO examination_hallway\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Examination Hallway\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a tool or method to open the clipboard holder. Looking at the environment, there's a cabinet key (key_1) inside the locked filing cabinet that might help, but accessing it would require opening another container. Alternatively, I should check if the clipboard holder can be opened without a key by interacting with it differently.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n10.

Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a tool or method to open the clipboard holder. Looking at the environment, there's a cabinet key (key_1) inside the locked filing cabinet that might help, but accessing it would require opening another container. Alternatively, I should check if the clipboard holder can be opened without a key by interacting with it differently.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n10.

Since the holder is a container, I should try to interact with it to open it.\nAction: GRAB clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object has other objects on/in it patient_forms_1, cannot grab\n9. Thought: The clipboard holder is a container that needs to be opened to access the patient intake forms. Since previous attempts to grab the forms or the holder directly failed, I need to find a tool or method to open the clipboard holder. Looking at the environment, there's a cabinet key (key_1) inside the locked filing cabinet that might help, but accessing it would require opening another container. Alternatively, I should check if the clipboard holder can be opened without a key by interacting with it differently.\nAction: GOTO clipboard_holder_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Wall-Mounted Clipboard Holder (in Check-In & Reception Desk)\n10.

Looking at the environment, there's a wrench (wrench_1) and screwdriver (screwdriver_1) in the medical cart in the Examination Hallway that might help open the clipboard holder. I should go to the Examination Hallway to get one of these tools.\nAction: GOTO examination_hallway\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Examination Hallway\n14. Thought: The wrench and screwdriver in the medical cart can be used to open the clipboard holder. I need to grab one of these tools first.\nAction: GRAB wrench_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object wrench_1 is in closed container Wheeled Medical Cart\n15.

Thought: The medical cart is too heavy to grab, and the wrench inside is inaccessible. I need to find another way to open the clipboard holder.
