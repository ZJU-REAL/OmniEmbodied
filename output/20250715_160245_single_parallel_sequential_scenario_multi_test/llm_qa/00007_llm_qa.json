Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is currently inside the gaylord_box_1 in the intake_bay. I need to first go to the intake_bay to access it.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n2. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the gaylord_box_1 in the intake_bay. I need to grab it first before moving it to the gloves_cart_1 in the sorting_floor.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n3. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the closed gaylord_box_1. I need to open the gaylord_box_1 first before I can grab the rubber_boot_1.\nAction: OPEN gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: OPEN\n4. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the closed gaylord_box_1, but there's no OPEN command available. I need to find another way to access it. The crowbar_1 in the intake_bay might help open the container.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Steel Crowbar before grabbing\n5. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the closed gaylord_box_1, and I need to access it. Since there's no OPEN command, I should first approach the crowbar_1 which might help open the container.\nAction: GOTO crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Steel Crowbar (in Intake Bay)\n6. Thought: Now that I'm near the crowbar_1, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the gaylord_box_1 to access the rubber_boot_1.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Steel Crowbar\n7. Thought: I now have the crowbar_1 which can be used to open the gaylord_box_1. I need to go to the gaylord_box_1 to access the rubber_boot_1 inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n8. Thought: I have the crowbar_1 which can be used to open the gaylord_box_1. Now I need to use it to access the rubber_boot_1 inside.\nAction: ASSEMBLE gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: ASSEMBLE\n9. Thought: Since the OPEN and ASSEMBLE commands are not available, I need to find another way to access the rubber_boot_1 inside the gaylord_box_1. The crowbar_1 might not be usable in this context. I should try to directly grab the rubber_boot_1 again after approaching the gaylord_box_1.\nAction: GRAB rubber_boot_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object rubber_boot_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n10. Thought: Since direct commands to open the container aren't available, I need to move the entire gaylord_box_1 to the sorting_floor where the gloves_cart_1 is located, then attempt to access the rubber_boot_1 there.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n11. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is still inside the closed gaylord_box_1, which is now in the sorting_floor. Since we can't open the container directly, we should try to place the entire gaylord_box_1 into the gloves_cart_1 to complete the task indirectly.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in gloves_cart_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n12. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the closed gaylord_box_1, and we cannot open it directly. Since we cannot access the boot directly, we need to first grab the gaylord_box_1 to move it to the gloves_cart_1.\nAction: GRAB gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must go to Intake Bay first to interact with Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the closed gaylord_box_1 in the intake_bay, and we cannot open it directly. Since we cannot access the boot directly, we need to first grab the gaylord_box_1 to move it to the gloves_cart_1 in the sorting_floor. I need to go back to the intake_bay to interact with the gaylord_box_1.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n14. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the closed gaylord_box_1 in the intake_bay, and we cannot open it directly. Since we cannot access the boot directly, we need to first grab the gaylord_box_1 to move it to the gloves_cart_1 in the sorting_floor. I am currently in the intake_bay where the gaylord_box_1 is located.\nAction: GRAB gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 物体长度1.2m超过智能体最大限制1.0m\n15. Thought: The rubber_boot_1 is inside the gaylord_box_1 which is too large to grab (1.2m length exceeds the 1.0m limit). Since we cannot open the container or move it directly, we need to find an alternative approach. The gloves_cart_1 is in the sorting_floor, so we should explore other objects that might help access the rubber_boot_1.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The rubber boot is inside a closed container (Empty Gaylord Box) and I need to open it first. Since there's no OPEN command available, I should try to use the crowbar I'm holding to open the box.\nAction: ASSEMBLE gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 未知命令: ASSEMBLE\n5. Thought: Since the OPEN and ASSEMBLE commands are not available, I need to find another way to access the rubber boot inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. The only option left is to move the entire box to the sorting table where it might be possible to open it later.\nAction: GRAB gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - 物体长度1.2m超过智能体最大限制1.0m\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box.

Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.

Thought: The hazardous waste drum is in the intake bay, and the crowbar is inside the empty gaylord box. I need to first get the crowbar from the gaylord box to use it on the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n2. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the crowbar.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n3. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box without holding it, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. However, the environment doesn't show any tools that can open the box. I should explore the room to see if there are any other objects that might help.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the knife first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the utility knife, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife, I can return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife and am back in the Intake Bay, I can attempt to use it to open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box first before attempting to use the utility knife to open it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

I need to open the box first before I can grab the crowbar.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n3. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box without holding it, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. However, the environment doesn't show any tools that can open the box. I should explore the room to see if there are any other objects that might help.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the knife first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the utility knife, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife, I can return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife and am back in the Intake Bay, I can attempt to use it to open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n10.

I need to open the box first before I can grab the crowbar.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n3. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box without holding it, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. However, the environment doesn't show any tools that can open the box. I should explore the room to see if there are any other objects that might help.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the knife first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the utility knife, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife, I can return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife and am back in the Intake Bay, I can attempt to use it to open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box first before attempting to use the utility knife to open it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the Empty Gaylord Box and holding the utility knife, I should use it to open the box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n12. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box still needs to be opened to access the crowbar inside. Since the knife is now on the box, I should attempt to open the box to retrieve the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box remains closed. Since the knife didn't automatically open the box, I need to find another way to open it. The crowbar is still inside the closed box, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum. I should check if there are other tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open the box or drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n14. Thought: The utility knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. The Sorting Floor has a screwdriver that might be more effective in opening the box to access the crowbar. I should grab the screwdriver next.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Phillips Screwdriver before grabbing\n15. Thought: The screwdriver is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.

Thought: The hazardous waste drum is in the intake bay, and the crowbar is inside the empty gaylord box. I need to first get the crowbar from the gaylord box to use it on the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n2. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the crowbar.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n3. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box without holding it, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. However, the environment doesn't show any tools that can open the box. I should explore the room to see if there are any other objects that might help.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the knife first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the utility knife, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife, I can return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife and am back in the Intake Bay, I can attempt to use it to open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box first before attempting to use the utility knife to open it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the Empty Gaylord Box and holding the utility knife, I should use it to open the box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n12. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box still needs to be opened to access the crowbar inside. Since the knife is now on the box, I should attempt to open the box to retrieve the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box remains closed. Since the knife didn't automatically open the box, I need to find another way to open it. The crowbar is still inside the closed box, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum. I should check if there are other tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open the box or drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n14. Thought: The utility knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. The Sorting Floor has a screwdriver that might be more effective in opening the box to access the crowbar. I should grab the screwdriver next.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Phillips Screwdriver before grabbing\n15. Thought: The screwdriver is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the screwdriver first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Phillips Screwdriver (in Sorting Floor)\n16. Thought: Now that I'm near the screwdriver, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Phillips Screwdriver\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The hazardous waste drum is in the intake bay, and the crowbar is inside the empty gaylord box. I need to first get the crowbar from the gaylord box to use it on the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n2. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the crowbar.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n3. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box without holding it, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. However, the environment doesn't show any tools that can open the box. I should explore the room to see if there are any other objects that might help.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the knife first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the utility knife, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife, I can return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife and am back in the Intake Bay, I can attempt to use it to open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box first before attempting to use the utility knife to open it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the Empty Gaylord Box and holding the utility knife, I should use it to open the box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n12. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box still needs to be opened to access the crowbar inside. Since the knife is now on the box, I should attempt to open the box to retrieve the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box remains closed. Since the knife didn't automatically open the box, I need to find another way to open it. The crowbar is still inside the closed box, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum. I should check if there are other tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open the box or drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n14. Thought: The utility knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. The Sorting Floor has a screwdriver that might be more effective in opening the box to access the crowbar. I should grab the screwdriver next.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Phillips Screwdriver before grabbing\n15. Thought: The screwdriver is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the screwdriver first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Phillips Screwdriver (in Sorting Floor)\n16. Thought: Now that I'm near the screwdriver, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Phillips Screwdriver\n17. Thought: Now that I have the screwdriver, I should return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The hazardous waste drum is in the intake bay, and the crowbar is inside the empty gaylord box. I need to first get the crowbar from the gaylord box to use it on the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n2. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the crowbar.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n3. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box without holding it, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. However, the environment doesn't show any tools that can open the box. I should explore the room to see if there are any other objects that might help.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the knife first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the utility knife, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife, I can return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife and am back in the Intake Bay, I can attempt to use it to open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box first before attempting to use the utility knife to open it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the Empty Gaylord Box and holding the utility knife, I should use it to open the box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n12. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box still needs to be opened to access the crowbar inside. Since the knife is now on the box, I should attempt to open the box to retrieve the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box remains closed. Since the knife didn't automatically open the box, I need to find another way to open it. The crowbar is still inside the closed box, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum. I should check if there are other tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open the box or drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n14. Thought: The utility knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. The Sorting Floor has a screwdriver that might be more effective in opening the box to access the crowbar. I should grab the screwdriver next.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Phillips Screwdriver before grabbing\n15. Thought: The screwdriver is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the screwdriver first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Phillips Screwdriver (in Sorting Floor)\n16. Thought: Now that I'm near the screwdriver, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Phillips Screwdriver\n17. Thought: Now that I have the screwdriver, I should return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n18. Thought: Now that I have the screwdriver and am back in the Intake Bay, I should approach the Empty Gaylord Box to attempt opening it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The hazardous waste drum is in the intake bay, and the crowbar is inside the empty gaylord box. I need to first get the crowbar from the gaylord box to use it on the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n2. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. I need to open the box first before I can grab the crowbar.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n3. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box without holding it, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. However, the environment doesn't show any tools that can open the box. I should explore the room to see if there are any other objects that might help.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n4. Thought: The crowbar is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since exploration didn't reveal any tools to open the box, I need to find another way to access the crowbar. The steel crowbar is the only tool mentioned that could potentially open the hazardous waste drum, but it's currently inaccessible. I should check if there are other tools in the sorting floor that could help open either the gaylord box or the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n5. Thought: The hazardous waste drum needs to be opened with the crowbar, which is currently inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box. Since we can't directly open the box, we should look for tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open either the box or the drum. The Sorting Floor has a utility knife and a screwdriver that might be useful.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Utility Knife before grabbing\n6. Thought: The utility knife is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the knife first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Utility Knife (in Sorting Floor)\n7. Thought: Now that I'm near the utility knife, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB knife_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Utility Knife\n8. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife, I can return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: Now that I have the utility knife and am back in the Intake Bay, I can attempt to use it to open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent must approach gaylord_box_1 before placing object\n10. Thought: I need to approach the Empty Gaylord Box first before attempting to use the utility knife to open it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n11. Thought: Now that I'm near the Empty Gaylord Box and holding the utility knife, I should use it to open the box to access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE knife_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Utility Knife on Empty Gaylord Box\n12. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box still needs to be opened to access the crowbar inside. Since the knife is now on the box, I should attempt to open the box to retrieve the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB crowbar_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Object crowbar_1 is in closed container Empty Gaylord Box\n13. Thought: The utility knife has been placed on the Empty Gaylord Box, but the box remains closed. Since the knife didn't automatically open the box, I need to find another way to open it. The crowbar is still inside the closed box, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum. I should check if there are other tools in the Sorting Floor that might help open the box or drum.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n14. Thought: The utility knife didn't successfully open the Empty Gaylord Box. The Sorting Floor has a screwdriver that might be more effective in opening the box to access the crowbar. I should grab the screwdriver next.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Phillips Screwdriver before grabbing\n15. Thought: The screwdriver is in the Sorting Floor and could potentially help open the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar. I need to approach the screwdriver first before grabbing it.\nAction: GOTO screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Phillips Screwdriver (in Sorting Floor)\n16. Thought: Now that I'm near the screwdriver, I should grab it to potentially use it for opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar.\nAction: GRAB screwdriver_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed Phillips Screwdriver\n17. Thought: Now that I have the screwdriver, I should return to the Intake Bay to attempt opening the Empty Gaylord Box to access the crowbar, which is needed to open the hazardous waste drum.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n18. Thought: Now that I have the screwdriver and am back in the Intake Bay, I should approach the Empty Gaylord Box to attempt opening it and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: GOTO gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Empty Gaylord Box (in Intake Bay)\n19. Thought: The screwdriver has been successfully grabbed and I'm now near the Empty Gaylord Box. I should attempt to use the screwdriver to open the box and access the crowbar inside.\nAction: PLACE screwdriver_1 in gaylord_box_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed Phillips Screwdriver on Empty Gaylord Box\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Since neither the utility knife nor the screwdriver successfully opened the box, I need to find another approach to access the crowbar inside.

Thought: The knife is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box, I need to find another way to access the knife. The crowbar inside the box could help open it, but I can't access that either. I should explore alternative methods or tools in the environment to open the box.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n5. Thought: The knife is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since there are no other tools available in the Intake Bay to open the box, I need to look for alternative tools in other rooms. The Sorting Floor has a Steel Crowbar inside the Wheeled Gloves Cart that could potentially help open the box.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6. Thought: The Steel Crowbar inside the Wheeled Gloves Cart in the Sorting Floor can be used to open the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay.

I need to open the box first before I can grab the knife.\nAction: PLACE gaylord_box_1 in open\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.INVALID - Agent does not hold object: gaylord_box_1\n4. Thought: The knife is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which needs to be opened first. Since I can't directly open the box, I need to find another way to access the knife. The crowbar inside the box could help open it, but I can't access that either. I should explore alternative methods or tools in the environment to open the box.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 explored Intake Bay but found no new objects\n5. Thought: The knife is inside the closed Empty Gaylord Box, which cannot be opened directly. Since there are no other tools available in the Intake Bay to open the box, I need to look for alternative tools in other rooms. The Sorting Floor has a Steel Crowbar inside the Wheeled Gloves Cart that could potentially help open the box.\nAction: GOTO sorting_floor\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Sorting Floor\n6.

Thought: The Steel Crowbar is actually inside the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay, not the Wheeled Gloves Cart. I need to return to the Intake Bay and use the crowbar to open the box and get the knife.\nAction: GOTO intake_bay\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Intake Bay\n9. Thought: The Steel Crowbar is inside the Empty Gaylord Box in the Intake Bay, which is currently closed. Since I can't directly open the box, I need to find another tool to open it. The Sorting Floor has a Phillips Screwdriver inside the Wheeled Gloves Cart that might help, but it's also inside a container.
