Since the current room (Main Sorting Floor) doesn't have any blue barrels listed, I should explore other rooms. The contraband storage room is currently empty and not explored, so I should go there first to check for the blue barrel or workbench.\nAction: GOTO contraband_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Contraband Storage\n2. Thought: The contraband storage room is currently empty and has no objects discovered. I need to explore this room to find the blue barrel or workbench mentioned in the task.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Contraband Storage and discovered 10 new objects\n3. Thought: The blue barrel (blue_barrel_1) is located on the metal shelving unit in the contraband storage room, and the workbench (workbench_1) is also in the same room. I need to grab the blue barrel and place it on the workbench.\nAction: GRAB blue_barrel_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Blue Barrel before grabbing\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires finding a blue barrel and placing it on a workbench in the contraband storage. First, I need to locate the blue barrel in the current environment. Since the current room (Main Sorting Floor) doesn't have any blue barrels listed, I should explore other rooms. The contraband storage room is currently empty and not explored, so I should go there first to check for the blue barrel or workbench.\nAction: GOTO contraband_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Contraband Storage\n2. Thought: The contraband storage room is currently empty and has no objects discovered. I need to explore this room to find the blue barrel or workbench mentioned in the task.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Contraband Storage and discovered 10 new objects\n3. Thought: The blue barrel (blue_barrel_1) is located on the metal shelving unit in the contraband storage room, and the workbench (workbench_1) is also in the same room. I need to grab the blue barrel and place it on the workbench.\nAction: GRAB blue_barrel_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Blue Barrel before grabbing\n4. Thought: The blue barrel is on the metal shelving unit, so I need to go to the metal shelving unit first before I can grab the blue barrel.\nAction: GOTO metal_shelving_unit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Metal Shelving Unit (in Contraband Storage)\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",

Thought: The task requires finding a blue barrel and placing it on a workbench in the contraband storage. First, I need to locate the blue barrel in the current environment. Since the current room (Main Sorting Floor) doesn't have any blue barrels listed, I should explore other rooms. The contraband storage room is currently empty and not explored, so I should go there first to check for the blue barrel or workbench.\nAction: GOTO contraband_storage\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully moved to Contraband Storage\n2. Thought: The contraband storage room is currently empty and has no objects discovered. I need to explore this room to find the blue barrel or workbench mentioned in the task.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Contraband Storage and discovered 10 new objects\n3. Thought: The blue barrel (blue_barrel_1) is located on the metal shelving unit in the contraband storage room, and the workbench (workbench_1) is also in the same room. I need to grab the blue barrel and place it on the workbench.\nAction: GRAB blue_barrel_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach Blue Barrel before grabbing\n4. Thought: The blue barrel is on the metal shelving unit, so I need to go to the metal shelving unit first before I can grab the blue barrel.\nAction: GOTO metal_shelving_unit_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Metal Shelving Unit (in Contraband Storage)\n5. Thought: Now that I'm near the metal shelving unit where the blue barrel is located, I can grab the blue barrel to proceed with placing it on the workbench.\nAction: GRAB blue_barrel_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - 超出重量限制（当前:0.0kg + 物体:15.0kg > 最大:10.0kg）\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
