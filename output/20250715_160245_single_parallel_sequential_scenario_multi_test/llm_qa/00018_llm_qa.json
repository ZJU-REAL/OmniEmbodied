Thought: The GPS buoy and decontamination tank are not visible in the current environment. I need to explore the rooms to find these objects.\nAction: EXPLORE\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 thoroughly explored Field Prep Deck and discovered 10 new objects\n2. Thought: The GPS buoy (gps_buoy_1) and decontamination tank (decontamination_tank_1) are both located in the Field Prep Deck where I am currently positioned. I need to pick up the GPS buoy first before placing it in the tank.\nAction: GRAB gps_buoy_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.FAILURE - Agent must approach GPS Buoy before grabbing\n3. Thought: I need to approach the GPS buoy (gps_buoy_1) before I can grab it, as indicated by the previous failure. Since both objects are in the same room, I'll go to the buoy first.\nAction: GOTO gps_buoy_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached GPS Buoy (in Field Prep Deck)\n4. Thought: Now that I have approached the GPS buoy (gps_buoy_1), I can proceed to grab it before placing it in the decontamination tank.\nAction: GRAB gps_buoy_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 successfully grabbed GPS Buoy\n5. Thought: I have successfully grabbed the GPS buoy (gps_buoy_1) and need to place it in the decontamination tank (decontamination_tank_1). Since both objects are in the same room, I should go to the tank first.\nAction: GOTO decontamination_tank_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 approached Decontamination Tank (in Field Prep Deck)\n6. Thought: I have approached the decontamination tank (decontamination_tank_1) while holding the GPS buoy (gps_buoy_1). Now I need to place the buoy into the tank.\nAction: PLACE gps_buoy_1 in decontamination_tank_1\n   Execution Result: ActionStatus.SUCCESS - robot_1 placed GPS Buoy on Decontamination Tank\n\nPlease analyze the current situation and provide the next action command.\n",
